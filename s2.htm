<H4>Education</H4>
Secondary education finished a very long time ago (left in 1976 if you must know), at a place called <A HREF="http://giraffe.rmplc.co.uk/eduweb/sites/barnyscl/">Barnard Castle School</A>, which I enjoyed very much. I managed to get out with 3 A levels anyway.<P>
Tertiary education mostly consisted of a couple of visits to the <A HREF="http://www.man.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</A> where I did Chemistry (wasn't very good at Organic), took a year off [<EM>involuntarily</EM>], and then did a year of a Liberal Studies in Science course.
<P>I was rather better at that; but still didn't finish the course.
<P>That was that; off to <A HREF="./s5.htm">work</A>.
<P>Well, that was that until I spent three years at the <A HREF="http://www.mmu.ac.uk/">Manchester Metropolitan University</A>, getting Postgraduate level qualifications in Marketing. Piece of advice for anyone reading - it gets tougher as you get older. Get it right <B>first</B> time.
