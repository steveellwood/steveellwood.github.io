<h1>Birthday Holiday Diary</h1>

<h2>Wednesday 7 May 2008 - 14.30</h2>

<p>Well, I suppose you have to say the holiday has really
started.
After numerous good-byes to the puppies, and a farewell and final
instructions to our house sitter (Kevin) we set off to drive from
Cromarty to the hotel.
Four and a half hours later (bad traffic in Glasgow) we arrived at the
hotel.
</p>

<p>Surprisingly, they had our reservation, the room was nice [and
quiet,
which isn't bad for an airport hotel] and we were able to get the car
parked up, and wander in for a very pleasant meal. (Since you ask, King
prawn Bruschetta &amp; Cannelloni Fiorentina to start, and a couple
of pizzas, chessboard and ice cream to finish. Very nice Nero d'Avola
Shiraz after a couple of Peroni &ndash; 2 Sambucca afterwards...
</p>

<p>The wireless broadband worked, so much to E's mixed enjoyment
and
irritation we were able to check her email &ndash; and S was able
to update some of his social networking rubbish...
So, Kevin's had his first &ldquo;Are the dogs OK&rdquo; email
&ndash; and Steve's tweeted from Glasgow.
A quiet stroll and then an early bed beckons.
</p>

<h2>Thursday 8 May 2008 1340</h2>

(1240 Iceland time (they run GMT all year round, despite
being
West of Scotland)
<p>We had a pretty ropy night&rsquo;s sleep, despite it being
a really
nice room. largely, I suspect down to the heat. At first we had to have
the window open, which meant it was noisy. Later, with the window shut
it again got stuffy, but it also started going light at around 4am.
Our in room breakfast was very pleasant &ndash; although delivered
half an hour late... and without the cutlery. [Bit hard to eat weetabix
and yogurt with no spoon!] Profuse apologies and no charge recovered
the position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We went and got the bags from the car (another reason for
choosing the
Ramada was 8 days parking included in the rate), and asked about
transport to the airport. Complimentary bus ready to depart
immediately.</p>

<p>Glasgow Airport was hot and very crowded, but check in was
efficient
and quick, with our luggage checked straight through to Boston. It was
too hot and stuffy to stay in the airport so we went for a
walk until closer to flight time.</p>

<p>Easily through security, with me not setting off a metal
detector for a
pleasant change. Bought a couple of books and magazines between us, and
off to the gate.</p>

<p>We were a bit delayed being called, and were bemused by the
typical
British inability to listen to the announcements. &ldquo;Passengers
needing pre-boarding, or with disabilities come forward...&rdquo; A
couple of suspiciously healthy looking women barged past us where we
were sitting... and were promptly dismissed away from the gate.</p>

<p>A queue/scrum developed and after about 10 or 15 minutes of
jockeying
for position, most of the queue had gone through. So we got up from our
seats and meandered onto the aircraft &ndash; where, of course, our
seats were available. Why does everyone queue to queue?</p>

<p>We had a spare seat beside us so was able to get the window
seat as
well. Little ham croissant and an orange juice, and the 2-hour flight
was nearly over.
Reykjavik is flat! The airport is very clean, beautifully designed, and
astonishingly quiet. We&rsquo;ve had a wander round the souvenir
shops, found our mobiles worked (though Steve's fancy phone isn't
synchronising mail today) and recognised that there was some wireless
access &ndash; just haven't paid for it yet.
About 2 hours or so until our next flight gets called.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We hung round in Reykjavik till our flight was called and
wandered in
to the plane.
We'd got the very last row of seats at the back &ndash; the ones
that don't recline... a nice stewardess moved us and again we had a row
of three between us.
A sad muppet had decided he wanted to keep an entire row to himself,
and wouldn't move to allow 2 ladies to sit together &ndash; so much
to our pleasure after we'd taken off, someone went to sit in his
row.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were given a meal of some chicken and veg in sauce, and
paid for a
&frac14; bottle of wine each. We flew over Greenland and got some
really good views of it &ndash;
E now wants to holiday there.

<p>
Arrival in Boston
was half an hour early; a longish queue at
border
control moved steadily through with courteous staff. Our fingerprints
and photographs are now on file in the US...
A polite information clerk directed us to the shuttle bus which took us
to the T (underground) and 2 stops later we were at the hotel. A basic
room, overlooking an atrium, with aircon - and free wireless!
<a href="images/IMG_2061.jpg"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 150px; height: 113px;" alt="hotel room" src="IMG_2061.jpg"></a></p>

<p>A quick shower, and
out we went for a stroll. Quincy market
was fun
&ndash; with loads of food stalls; all of which looked tempting.
<a href="images/IMG_2055.jpg"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 150px; height: 113px;" alt="Quincy Market" src="IMG_2055.jpg"></a>We
managed a quick drink in the Black Rose despite E being
tired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that we
decide to go for a lobster roll... but got
distracted by
the sight of a seafood special about 4 foot tall at the Kingfish hall.
We ended up with a rather fancy meal , starting with a couple of
Margaritas and S having oysters, then Surf 'n Turf. We split a rather
nice Chardonnay. E had a Thai Bouillabaisse with prawns clams, mussels
and &frac12; a lobster. A coffee and a sorbet rounded the meal off
nicely. <a href="images/IMG_2049.jpg"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 150px; height: 113px;" alt="Kingfish hall food" src="IMG_2049.jpg"></a>
<a href="images/IMG_2050.jpg"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 150px; height: 113px;" alt="Kingfish hall food" src="IMG_2050.jpg"></a><a href="images/IMG_2051.jpg"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 150px; height: 113px;" alt="Kingfish hall food" src="IMG_2051.jpg"></a>
Back to the hotel, dog-tired &ndash; and off to sleep.
</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Friday 9 May 2008</h2>

<p>A rather disturbed
nights sleep we woke up; showered and
sorted out our
day bag. Steve rang his Mum and then we went in search of coffee and
breakfast.
Quincy market beckoned, so Breakfast Burrito and sausages and pancakes
were found, with a rather nice coffee. Love it. &ldquo;Just a black
coffee and a flat white please&rdquo; Choice of 5 coffees.
We went for a walk along the freedom trail stopping off at Faneiul
Hall, 
<a href="images/IMG_2056.jpg"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 150px; height: 113px;" alt="Faneiul Hall" src="IMG_2056.jpg"></a>
and the State House; <a href="images/IMG_2072.jpg"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 150px; height: 113px;" alt="State House" src="IMG_2072.jpg"></a>
rather sad little vignettes at the
Granary burying ground and a walk on Boston Common [Sadly, of course,
rather small compared to the Royal parks in London..&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were tempted by
a fresh lemonade stand; lemons squeezed, ice added and a dilute sugar
syrup added. Very refreshing.
We managed to speak to Kevin, Mum and Dad and Susan. Kevin seems to be
OK with the boys &ndash; Ollie seems to be pining most &ndash;
and the weather in Cromarty &ndash; very warm and Sunny!
Appetite restored, we wandered round a bit admiring the flourishing
fish and veg markets and commenting on how horrid the JFK Federal
building was.</p>

<p> Back to Quincy
market for lunch &ndash; a bowl of
clam chowder and a Summer ale...
Bit of souvenir shopping &ndash; and a rather disappointing visit
to a knife shop then back to the hotel to update the diary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next stop the Duck
Tour...We left the hotel about 3pm
&ndash; it
was meant to be a 15 minute walk but....we took a wrong turn somewhere
and it was in fact a 30 minute route march, in pouring rain and amidst
extremely busy traffic! Still we arrived just on time at the Museum of
Science and boarded our duck - &ldquo;Frog Pond Lily&rdquo;
with Captain Covert.2076 DUKWs paid a vital role in WWII as
they could run on land and water and were used to transport supplies at
Normandy. Our Duck was the best in the fleet, bigger, faster and better
equipped. We were told the point of the tour was Freedom, Firsts and
Fun. We set off round the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many points of
interest were pointed
out to us:- the Prudential Tower, impressive Copley Square, Boston
Common, State House, numerous churches, Bunker Hill 2084, USS
Constitution. The Back Bay area was impressive, it was reclaimed from
the sea at the end of the 19th Century and so moved the harbour. A lot
of money has been spent recently to reroute/extend the main highway.
The new bridge was very striking.2082/2184&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new park area has
also
been created and a new skate park will follow. We splashed into the
Charles River t2084o get a waterside view of the river, past a marina
full of expensive looking yachts, under the Longfellow Bridge with the
salt and pepper shaped towers. 2087&nbsp;</p>

<p>We saw a goose
nesting in a large
planter with her mate sitting in a tree. Back to the Museum to
disembark. The captain had been very informative and friendly, so was
given a good tip.
We walked back in the rain to Quincy Market, it was a much quicker walk
as we found the right road this time!
We stopped off to look at the Old Union Oyster House &ndash; a
monument and the oldest continually running restaurant in the
US.2088/90&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was a moving
holocaust memorial close by. Time for
coffee and cream cakes &ndash; which we couldn't manage to finish.
Back to the hotel to read and watch TV for a while or sleep in
Estelle's case. At 9pm we left the hotel to go for tea in Quincy's
Market as we thought it was open till10pm &ndash; it was just
closing. So we went to a Tex Mex which we had spotted earlier. A quick
beer then Enchiladas for Estelle and mixed Enchilada, Burrito and Taco
for Steve. No dessert. Back to the hotel, shower and bed.
</p>

<h2>Saturday 10 May
2008</h2>

<p>Today is our
birthday! 2099
Estelle woke up at 7am and needed the bathroom, Steve put her card in
the bed whilst she was out. We then opened our cards to each other. He
did make the point that he was not yet 50 &ndash; more than once.
We had fresh orange juice which we had purchased in the corner shop the
night before but no champagne. Maybe later??? </p>

<p>We agreed the plan
for
the day, showered, dressed and out to the shop for postcards and
Quincy's for breakfast. The phone rang &ndash; it was Philip and
Rowan ringing to wish Steve a happy birthday. Well, and Auntie Pip too!
We booked on the City View trolley tours which has a total of 9 stops
round the city and included a 45 minute boat trip round the
harbour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Found the postcard
shop and went to Quincy's for breakfast.
Steve had a
Boston breakfast roll and Estelle had an Italian sausage pannini and
orange juice. Steve then went to get a coffee and came back with a
pastrami roll too! We wrote our postcards and then went to the post
office to get stamps. They will also be stamped with Faneuil Hall
&ndash; but who knows how long they will take to get to the
UK!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then we went to the
trolley bus stop outside the Aquarium
(need to look
at that later). 2187 We went round some parts of Boston which we had
already seen but the running commentary from the driver was informative
and lots of political banter too. We got off at the naval base, stop
4.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We went round the
Constitution museum which was very
interesting and
gave the story of the ship throughout its 200 years. Amazing how many
times it has been on the verge of being scrapped and then been saved at
the last minute for renovation.
</p>

<p>We went off to see
the ship but on the way saw the 2103 /2110
USS
Cassin Young, a WW11 destroyer. It is a 2050 ton fletcher class
destroyer, which were considered to be the best destroyers, ready to
fight attacks from the air. It carried dual purpose guns, torpedoes,
depth charges and anti-aircraft guns. It was actually named after Cmdr
Young who was in command of the ship Vestal which was moored beside the
Arizona when it was blown up at Pearl Harbour. He was blown overboard
but managed to get back on board with most of his crew to rescue
survivors from the Arizona and then moved the Vestal across the harbour
where it was later salvaged. He was then made Captain of the San
Francisco but died on 12 November when this ship was attacked by
Japanese warship was awarded the Navy Cross.</p>

<p>The Cassin Young
participated in several actions in the
Pacific and
took part in the Okinawa operation. She experienced a number of
kamikaze attacks but on July 30 a kamikaze crashed the starboard side
of the ship and 22 men were killed and 45 wounded. . The ship was
decommissioned in 1946 until 1951 when she was recalled to serve in the
Korean War and was decommissioned again in 1960. over the years she has
been given a number of awards. She has been open to the public since
1981when she was restored to her 1950's appearance.</p>

<p>The USS
Constitution is the oldest commissioned war ship
afloat in the
world. She was built in 1797 as one of the first ships of the US Navy.
In 1803 she was the flagship in the Barbary Wars. She took part in a
battle in 1812 against the British ship HMS Guerriere and earned the
nickname of &ldquo;Old Ironsides&rdquo; as a canon had failed
to damage the hull. She is made of live oak which is unique to America.
in 1830 she was declared unseaworthy and was condemned for scarp. A
poem called &ldquo;Old Ironsides&rdquo; was written by Oliver
Wendell Holmes aroused popular feeling and money was raised for her
restoration in 1833. Since then she has made a number of voyages and
been restored a number of times. In 1997 she sailed on her 200th
birthday &ndash; this was the first time in 100 years. She is
America's ship of state and Constitution Day is celebrated
annually.2112/8/7</p>

<p>Back on the trolley
bus into town with a very irritating
driver who
talked mostly about baseball! Time for lunch &ndash; in Quincy's of
course. Chicken Teriyaki for Estelle and Chicken &amp; Shrimp for
Steve and diet cokes. We managed to sit outside the hall on a bench as
the sun had come out. </p>

<p>Everywhere was very
busy. We then went for a stroll round the
harbour
and saw a couple of old clippers, lots of expensive looking yachts and
Boston Harbour cruise Ships. We had a look *at* the aquarium, and were
delighted by the antics of a tankful of Atlantic seals; swimming round
upside down, having a zizz at the bottom of the tank, and generally
performing to an admiring crowd.</p>

<p>2120/27/35
We boarded our ship at 1630 for our cruise around the harbour. It was
interesting to see Boston from the waterside and the views of the
varied buildings were excellent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Coastguard
ships were obviously
of interest and we could not believe how many planes were actually
coming in over the harbour to the airport. The running commentary was
also good &ndash; although of course by now we have heard some it
several times.
2139/44
Forgot to mention &ndash; sorted out plans for tomorrow &ndash;
we are booked on the 10am Whale Watch &ndash; weather
permitting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This means pack up,
drop luggage at reception and be at the
harbour for
09.45 on our last day in Boston.
We picked up a coffee from the foyer and came upstairs to write diary
and start packing. Well, Estelle is writing the diary and Steve is NOT
packing!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are off to the
Barking Crab for our birthday meal next.
And off we went... after Steve's last attempt we weren't at all sure
how we'd find our way there. Still, nothing ventured. We walked out
onto the waterfront and headed south. Some excellent
apartment/conference buildings &ndash; which is always nice compare
to derelict wharf buildings...
We followed the seafront past a rather interesting water taxi (hmm,
might be tempting to get to the airport in that tomorrow), and much to
our delight saw the first bridge we were looking for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recognised a
restaurant near the one we wanted and started to cross the bridge.
Much to our surprise, we were hailed by a young lad on a trike... he
was a pedal taxi. He took us across the bridge and round to the Barking
Crab.
2178/2167&nbsp;</p>

<p>We found our way in
and were quickly seated at a window table
overlooking the harbour, on high stools. A beer each &ndash; and we
ordered. E had easy peel shrimps, S had steamers(soft shell clams) [E's
shrimps had been cooked in a tomatoey sauce &ndash; which was
unnecessary for nice shrimps; S's clam were a bit sandy, though
nice.]&nbsp;</p>

<p>E had the baked
stuffed lobster (scallops and shrimps) S had
the mixed
crab bowl, which he was warned would usually do 2 people, often
4.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This
was a mix of snow, Dungeness and King crab, and S was a bit intimidated
when 3 tired, full looking chaps on the next table started laughing as
his crab arrived. The 3 of them had failed to finish their meal...
which was the same crab bowl. 2170&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were presented
with the traditional rock to break the claws
of the
crabs/lobster.
A lovely bottle of Chardonnay arrived, and we chatted to the manager
who'd heard we came from Scotland - which he'd visited
recently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While we were
eating the waitress (server) came back and said
in honour of our birthday, they were presenting us with Barking Crab
Tshirt. Which was nice.
E finished her lobster, S just about got half way through his
crab.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We
wandered through to the other end of the restaurant, and enjoyed the
view &ndash; it's normally open to the elements, but roll down
screens kept out the breeze. It's right over the harbor. After coffee,
we paid and strolled back to the hotel, where S did the diary while E
packed.
Packed and showered off to bed we went.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sunday 11 May
2008&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We woke, S very
carefully not commenting about waking up with
a woman
over 50...
We rang to see if the WhaleWatch boat was running. Recorded message
saying the office was open Mon-Sat. great.
We went downstairs with bags and checked out, leaving bags for later.
Across to the centre, where we learned the trip was cancelled.</p>

<p> Sadness.
So, off to the New England Aquarium instead. Paid our entry
and decide to get breakfast in the cafe, open 9-11 for breakfast.
Evidently, except on Sundays, as there was no hot food at 0950. So off
elsewhere for brekkie. A very forgettable Starbucks (service slower and
less selection than in the UK, which was a surprise).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back to the
aquarium which was excellent. We loved the
penguins,
2201and the giant tank (23 feet deep with a spiral walkway around it)
was enthralling. E thought 3 sharks was probably excessive; 2222 I
think our favourite denizen was a giant sea turtle, called Myrtle.2209
There are embedded water sprays in the penguin enclosure, and it was
funny to see them enjoying a protracted shower. 2225&nbsp;</p>

<p>They have
rockhoppers, African and Little Blue penguins.
A special exhibition about jellys was fascinating &ndash;
particularly the opportunistic way they are colonising areas damaged by
man through sewage/fertiliser/overfishing. 2199&nbsp;</p>

<p>After footling
round there for a couple of hours, we decided
we needed
a walk and lunch. Quincys Market again (Philly steak/prime rib
sandwiches).
Street performers (living statues, yoyoers, jugglers, and street
drummers were perfuming all over the place. Sadly we were flagging a
bit by then, so had a bit of a rest/doze people watching for a bit.</p>

<p>Stirring into
action, we went for a walk along the harbour and
the
North End. Some very nice penthouses and houses for only $1M or so...
on the way back we found another water taxi point, much closer to the
hotel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nipped back into
the aquarium for a last look at penguins and
seals (and to use the loo) and then we went to pick our bags up from
the hotel.
5 minutes walk to the water taxi point. Picked up the mike and said
&ldquo;Pickup at station 15, please?&rdquo; Voice comes back
&ldquo;8 minutes, sir&rdquo;.2228/2223
And it was too. Little diddy boat arrives, captain takes our bags (and
$20). 7 minutes later we're across the harbour at the airport shuttle
bus stop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Straight up to
checkin sorting out the bags (S's bag is up to
the weight limit, which E says is because he keeps buying books!).
Straight through to departures &ndash; no security delays, probably
less than 5 minutes to go through &ndash; and then we cooked in the
hot lounge. Some duty frees for Kevin, and then something to eat at the
little Chinese stall. Since Logan was going to charge $7.95 for wifi, S
just did diary instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now waiting for the
flight to be called.
The flight was called, and much to our surprise we were called by row
&ndash; which made boarding far simpler. When we go on,
there was a very insistent lad saying he was in our row. &ldquo;I'm
by the window, Row D&rdquo;. When he saw our boarding passes
D&amp;E aisle and middle, he realised he was in seat A. The flight
was very full, so we waited with trepidation. We ended up being one of
the fortunate ones who split a row of 3 between 2.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Monday 12 May
2008&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We'd decided we
weren't going to eat, so did our best to
sleep. S
needed nasal spray, so groping round on the floor woke Estelle
up. We did both manage to get some sleep.
Arrived in Reykjavik, and got off OK &ndash; but were perturbed to
have to go through a full hand baggage scan on arrival, including
losing our bottled water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting through
passport control and customs to arrivals, it
took us a
minute or two to find our way to the city. FlyBus takes you direct to
your hotel (and back) for about &pound;8.50 per person each way,
which was easy.
To our delight, when we arrived at the Hotel at around 0800, they had a
room available straight away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3 hours sleep
later, we surfaced.
2214
We walked down into Reykjavik, through the inevitable rain. quite a lot
of graffiti about, and the odd shop past its sell by date. As we got
further into town things began to look a bit more interesting, and we
got a bit peckish. Into a pizza place - which boasted
branches in Roma, Napoli, Madrid, Rio and... Reykjavik.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortified, with the
most expensive bottle of white wine I've
ever drunk
with a pizza, we had a walk on down to the harbour.2238 /2240&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quick
diversion into a flea market for a wander about, and back on our way
again. Lots of fishing boats, fishing cruises and whale watches
available. Having footled round for an hour or so, we decided to go
back.
Stopping off for a coffee and free wifi, we checked mail and got a nice
reply from our dogsitter, so E dashed off a quick line to him.
Back at the hotel it was just about time to get changed, so we ordered
a taxi, and went to get gussied up...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Off to the Perlan
restaurant. This is a large glass dome
mounted on top
of 4 hot water storage tanks. [Reykjavik has a pretty good
infrastructure. Spring water for cold water, no need for bottled water
here...; very cheap geothermal hot water for water/heating.
geothermal/hydro electricity]
2244/2256&nbsp;</p>

<p>The restaurant
rotates 360 degrees over 2 hours giving
wonderful views
over Reykjavik. A local beer led into lobster soup garnished with
lobster tail; langoustine and bacalo brandade.
This was followed by venison and lamb, with a nice Cabernet Sauvignon,
and a blueberry sorbet and skyr, and strawberry clafoutis... and two
espressos.
We wandered up to the rooftop bar and had a G&amp;T while watching
the dining room revolve beneath us. A taxi back to the hotel
left us in a position to get some cards and check email again. Kevin
seems to be having a lovely time.
S did diary while E sorted out packing and receipts.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tuesday 13 May
2008&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A lie in until 9am
today &ndash; not had many of those
this
holiday! Down for hotel breakfast &ndash; basic help yourself
continental style which was fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Off walking to the
city again to buy
souvenirs and a jumper for Steve. It was quite grey, windy and damp.
Stopped in a couple of shops before finding the one we wanted. It's
always hard to decide what to buy when you have to consider the
implications for packing. Steve chose a beautiful grey Icelandic wool
jumper. The kind shop assistant wrapped any fragile items as well as
she could. She was quite chatty in broken English. She was actually
Finnsh, came to Reykyavik to college and decided to stay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then off to
the Kaffitar for an expresso, cappuccino and check emails. A lovely
email from Kevin to say that we could stay longer! Estelle gave him a
ring &ndash; good job too, as he couldn't remember where the dog
food was for the next week. All seems to be going well there.
A quick route march back to the hotel then, as we were booked on a
coach trip at 12 noon to see the sights of Iceland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The feeder coach
arrived just after 12 and we were taken to the head office to pick up
tickets and wait for the actual bus &ndash; which turned out to be
our feeder coach &ndash; so quite small and cramped. The driver
seemed ignorant but we then realised he had no headphone/ microphone to
speak to us. He called in and arranged to meet another bus at a
garage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He then introduced
himself and said we had to pick up 2 more
people at
the Laxas riding stables. This was owned originally by a man who became
a famous author.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We then set off to
Thingelvir, the site of the ancient
parliament
across some barren volcanic looking terrain with snow capped mountains.
We stopped at the canyon and walked though to the site of the
parliament and street fairs. We also saw the Drowning Pool where women
were ducked for infantile crimes. If they survived the ducking
&ndash; they were then beheaded or burned for being
witches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the
way out, across the three wooden bridges we saw some lovely deep
channels filled with sparkling clear water &ndash; very inviting
for a swim, but very cold by the looks of it.2273/5&nbsp;</p>

<p>From Thingelvirr we
set off to Gulfoss &ndash; a
spectacular
waterfall, which has to massive cascades. We stopped near a viewpoint,
and were invited to walk along to the upper cascade. A fairly steep
slope down, with a roped walkway. Huge amounts of spray were blowing
over the path, and there was an incessant roar as the water gushed into
the gorge and down the deep ravine. 2287/91/98/2313&nbsp;</p>

<p>A bit of hairy
clambering around on the rocks for photos, and
we wended
our way back up towards the cafe, pausing at the upper viewpoint where
someone had chalked in pink &ldquo;Remember the kiss!&rdquo;.
So we did. Off to the cafe/souvenir stall, which provided a nice lamb
soup for S and a sandwich for Estelle. It's surely a universal truth
that things are more expensive in tourist joints, S's jumper would have
been about 20% more expensive here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bus then took
us to Geysir &ndash; the geothermal area
which
provided the universal name for geysers everywhere. Geysir itself lay
dormant from 1972-2000 when an earthquake woke it. It now erupts 4-5
times a day. However, Strokkur - which is beside it - it
erupts every few minutes, very satisfactorily. There were some nice
boiling pools, including one with a lovely deep cave inside it. While
you could smell sulphur, it wasn't as intense as Rotorua.
2330/46/33/40&nbsp;</p>

<p>We headed off to
Kratir, a crater, surprisingly enough, where
a magma
chamber had collapsed leaving a hole down into the ground, full of
water &ndash; which rose and fell with the water table. It looked
satisfyingly scary from close to the edge...
2360/58
Well ahead of time, we had a little diversion to another waterfall
&ndash; with a helpful fish ladder beside it; some passengers
didn't believe it was a fish ladder, until the driver told them.
2354&nbsp;</p>

<p>We called in at the
last formal stop &ndash; a garden
centre,
heated by geothermal springs. Possibly they get a kickback from the
ice-cream sales, as we wandered round with huge cones admiring the
tropical plants. It occurred that the garden centre can't get that many
plant sales from a tourist bus...
Interesting to see all the glasshouses full of plants &ndash;
including banana trees. We enjoyed our huge ice creams then back to the
coach for a drive round a geo-thermal electricity plant which provides
extremely cheap electricity for the island by utilising all the water
from the natural hot springs. There are plans for many more such plants
over the next few years.2363
Back to the hotel then and time to think about some sorting out and
packing etc. and quick phone calls to Mum and Dad and Susan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Evening
meal in the hotel restaurant. No Viking beer so had to have Carlsberg!
We both had the cream of onion soup followed by surf and turf
&ndash; lumps of steak with lobster tails (langoustine tails in
fact) . It was difficult to explain to the waitress that we wanted it
cooked rare but we obviously succeeded as it was cooked perfectly but
we were glad that we had ordered salad from the salad bar as it was
served with one potato. We had a nice bottle of red too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The restaurant
was a different organisation so we had to pay rather than add to the
bill. Off to bed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Wednesday 14 May
2008&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Early rise at 7am
for a quick hotel breakfast as we were
booked on the
8am coach to go whale watching.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve asked Oddur
to book the flybus for
the following morning to take us to the airport. We had some
discussions about this as the first bus would pick us up at 5am but not
get to the airport until 6.15 as it was a pick up bus. This would be
tight, as our flight is at 7.20 so really we are supposed to check in
at 5.20. Several discussions on the available options during the
day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bus eventually
picked us up, and took us to the tour HQ.
Tickets
collected, we boarded the bus for the harbour. We queued up to collect
our tickets, chatting to 2 older American ladies (who weren't
Republicans, judging by their colourful views on GWB, and their
laughing dismissal of Clinton's indiscretions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a little
while, we were ushered onto the boat
&ndash; where
we were joined by a school party of 10-12 year old children, giggling
and shrieking everywhere. Lots of chat about the sort of whales we
might see; how we might recognise them; their feeding patterns; their
schooling patterns. All very well, but in short, there was a complete
absence of whales... still the day was lovely, there were beautiful
views of the mountains. 2367/73/83&nbsp;</p>

<p>We had a 10 minute
stop at Puffin Island where thousands of
the comical
little birds (of which more later) flew swam and burrowed. Some dodgy
looking blackbacked gulls though.
2389/92&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back to the harbour
and a quick look round the Whale Watch
exhibition,
lots of information about whales found in the Bay and video clips too
&ndash; of whales performing on other trips &ndash; a bit like
rubbing salt in the wound really! 2365
We waited for the feeder bus to take us to the Blue Lagoon, only 5 of
us in total &ndash; the 2 older American ladies who were going to
the Lagoon on their way to the airport and a very chatty lady from
Boston.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We travelled
through more volcanic terrain and then we could
see steam
rising behind the hills so we had arrived. We saw pools of milky blue
water, which were steaming. On arrival the first priority was food as
we were starving as it was about 2.30pm. We agreed with the driver that
he would pick us up at 5.15pm so we had plenty of time. A quick
sandwich and coke and then off to rent towels and trunks for Steve.
Once changed and showered we entered the lagoon. &ndash; a large
steaming lake. The floor was very rocky and we kept stubbing our toes.
It was between 18inches and 5 ft deep. It was warm, very warm or hot!
2404/07&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sun was shining
but there was a cool breeze so it was
really pleasant sitting in the warm water. In some areas there were hot
springs bubbling into the lagoon so it got quite hot near them There
was a sulphur smell but not as pungent as in Rotorua (NZ). We tried
sitting under the waterfall, supposed to be therapeutic for people with
neck, shoulder and back problems &ndash; it was actually quite
painful. Steve tried the sauna and steam rooms but Estelle just relaxed
in the pool &ndash; surprised that she was actually enjoying it, as
she had been apprehensive about it.
Time to get showered and dressed. Everywhere was absolutely clean and
spotless.</p>

<p> Back to the bus
and just us and the lady from Boston who told
us about an excellent Icelandic seafood restaurant she had been to
&ldquo;Prika Frakka&rdquo; which sold whale steak and puffin
&ndash; sounds interesting. We also had a long chat about property
prices in Boston, renovating properties and the fact that after 10
years she was now entitled to 17 days annual leave.
Back in the hotel, another chat with Oddur about the travel
arrangements
for the next morning as Estelle thought it was going to be too tight to
get to the airport at 06.15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oddur suggested
that we should get a bus
from the bus station directly to the airport at 04.45 which would take
45 minutes and so give us more time to check in etc. He booked a taxi
for 04.20 for us &ndash; looks like a very early night tonight is
required.
Off to pack &ndash; how much more can there be to pack? We also
noticed that we had caught the sun on our faces, necks and
shoulder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve looked
through the Reykjavik guide and found details
about the
restaurant mentioned by the Boston lady. We decided to give it a go.
Went to see Oddur to find out how to get to it. He rang the restaurant
to book a table for us for 7.30pm and we then decided to get a taxi
&ndash; which he also sorted out.
The taxi took us through the posher end of town with the Embassy
buildings- still lots of graffiti though. We had a walk for 10 minutes
as we were early.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then into the
restaurant which was quite smart but
very warm. We were seated in the extension in the sun so E had to
borrow Steve&rsquo;s sunglasses. Straightaway, a menu and a jug of
water arrived. Had a beer whilst we looked at the menu &ndash;
Steve went for the smoked puffin breast followed by the whale steak.
Estelle chose the scallops in a creamy sauce and the fresh seafood dish
of the day &ndash; guillimot!! Unfortunately &ndash; no
guillimot left so E had the seafood au gratin &ndash; mussels
pawns, lobster in a cheesy sauce.
The smoked puffin breast was excellent &ndash; a bit like very
tender strips of duck but maybe a bit richer in flavour.
Estelle&rsquo;s scallops were delicious &ndash; the sauce had a
mild curry flavour. The whale steak was excellent &ndash; like the
very best of fillet steak, very moist and tender &ndash; Estelle
wished she had been brave enough to choose it too! The seafood au
gratin was also very tasty. Accompanied by a pleasant very expensive
shiraz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We then had dessert
&ndash; a sort of cr&egrave;me
brulee and strawberry cheesecake with large espresso. Only one malt on
offer &ndash; Dalmore &ndash; so we had a wee one as it was our
last night. We walked back to the hotel as it was a pleasant
evening - and light in fact until 1am. Quick tidy up, set
alarms and bed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Thursday 15 May
2008&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The alarms were set
for 4am but we both awake at 03.50 so
straight up
and dressed and squashed the last few bits into the cases. Down to wait
for the taxi, which arrived early and off to the bus station and
straight on to a very busy bus. Amazingly we actually made the 04.30
bus!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We arrived at the
airport and located our luggage from the
bowels
of the bus. Straight to check in and promptly sorted. We then had to
find the customs desk to get our receipt stamped to claim a tax refund
from the souvenir shop. Fortunately, she stamped it even though we had
already checked or bags in which contained our purchses., Steve signed
the form and posted it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Straight through
departures and a toasted
sandwich and a drink for breakfast. Steve could not get a wireless
access so he wrote some diary whilst E went and spent the last of the
kroner. Hard to realise that only a week before we had sat in the same
lounge waiting to board the plane to Boston.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flight was
fine, left on time. We had opposite aisle seats
this
time, both managed a kip and Steve ate the omelette breakfast. Usual
hassle getting off the plane and through customs and at baggage reclaim
Steve managed to knock a lady over who would not move to allow him to
retrieve our bags &ndash; she was fine &ndash; he ripped his
nail and was bleeding everywhere!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We wandered outside
to the bus stops
just as the bus for the Ramada arrived. Glad to see the car was still
there although there was a scratch on the wing mirror. We loaded all
the luggage and set off. Quick ring to Kevin to let him know that we
were on our way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t
wait to see the boys now!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The traffic
was reasonably quiet but it&rsquo;s still a bit hairy negotiating
round Glasgow. We were pleased to see a sign for Perth &ndash; it
tells you that you are really on the way home &ndash; well only 150
miles to go! It was agreed S would drive to the A9 just outside Perth
then E would take over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We stopped at our
usual services in Perth for
diesel, sandwiches, coffee and the loo. It seemed very strange not
walking the boys round the grass verge. Steve decided he felt OK to
drive so off we went. E tried to snooze then just as she dropped off, S
informed her that he had to stop as he was about to doze at the
wheel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quick changeover, S
was snoring virtually before we had moved
out of
the layby. S awoke just as we were going over the Kessock Bridge
&ndash; after an hour of snoring. He rang Kevin to update
him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just
after 3pm we arrived home, Kevin let the boys out, the noise was
overwhelming! They were so excited and so were we. Big hugs for Kevin
too. The dogs all obviously adored him and he was definitely fond of
them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He had survived the
week with them although he had been lonely
at
times but we can&rsquo;t thank him enough. They had obviously
enjoyed being with him and it sounds like they have behaved, mostly.
.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And us? Well we
have had an excellent holiday, a birthday to
remember
and for now we are tired and glad to be home Kevin cooked us a lovely
meal which was a perfect end to our holiday.
