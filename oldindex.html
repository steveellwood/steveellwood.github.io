  <title>Ellwoods of Cromarty; Work, life, and holidays</title>





</head>





<body>



<h1>The Ellwood Family</h1>



<h2>Site Purpose</h2>



<p>This site was allegedly about the life and activities of the

Ellwood

family of <a href="cromarty.html">Cromarty</a>.</p>



<p><em>A large part of this was Steve's desire to update

his

10 year old

knowledge of how websites work. He'd not done anything significant

since ooh, about 1995. Since he was editor of the local website, he

thought it might be sensible to understand how HTMl worked nowadays.

Much to his horror, he found things called style sheets and XHTML.

He was very pleased that the entire site was  handcoded using <a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/steveb/cpaap/pfe/default.htm" title="Home page for PFE">PFE</a>, but admits he

used&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.nvu.com/" title="Nvu home page">Nvu</a>

for some grunt work. He does need to work out how to use Nvu better for

coding XHTML, though the full release helps. This site is valid - see

the box at the bottom</em></p>



<p>We've now been here for over 6 years but still like it a great

deal.</p>



<p>We'll provide pictures of the area and the things that

interest us. There will be links to Holiday information, both about

where we've been , and where we recommend.</p>



<div id="holidays">

<h2>Holidays</h2>



<p>At the moment, the only links are to the work in progress of

the 1999 <a href="nz.html" title="A 2 week New Zealand Idyll">New

Zealand</a> holiday, the 2000 <a href="singaporediary.html" title="Christmas in Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="spanish.html" title="Spain with kids">Spanish</a>

holidays, though the Spanish one is brief... and the 2001 <a href="hebrides.html" title="a fast week in slow islands">Hebridean</a>

holiday. We did go on another holiday to the Hebrides in 200y, and

Boston &amp; Iceland in 2008 but that was about it.</p>



</div>



<div id="recommendations">

<h2>Recommendations</h2>



<p>We travel round with six dogs, see below. For most places

that makes you very unwelcome.</p>



<p> In Cromarty, you get a friendly welcome and real ale at the <a href="http://www.go-bedandbreakfast.co.uk/cromartyarms/">Cromarty

Arms</a>, but that's cheating a bit, as we live in Cromarty...</p>



<p>On the West side of Scotland, in Gairloch, you get nice rooms,

good food and real ale at the <a href="http://www.theoldinn.net/" title="very busy website">Old Inn</a>.&nbsp;<em><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Very</em>

busy in the summer, but well worth a visit at anytime. We used to be

welcome there a couple of times a year, but with 6 dogs, they no longer

want us :-(</p>



<p>On Skye, a really nice welcoming hotel is the <a href="http://www.uighotel.com/uig_hotel.htm" title="Website sadly designed for IE">Uig Hotel</a> -

and even their own duck eggs for breakfast, if you're lucky.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>



<p>We moved to Cromarty from Manchester in England in July 2003.

We're both Homeworkers, Steve as an IT Consultant and Estelle running

the Virtual Learning Centre on the Black Isle.</p>



<h2>Hobbies</h2>



<p> Steve is a member of the local <a href="http://cromartycoastguard.co.uk">Coastguard Search and

Rescue Team</a></p>



<p>He also quite likes outdoorsy stuff, although Estelle suspects

this

is because he likes all the kit. You can see a description of his first

night in a <a href="hammock.html" title="kipping in a hammock">hammock</a>.</p>



<h2>Pets</h2>



<p>We have 6 dogs. </p>

  <li>Ollie</li>



  <li>Pepper</li>



  <li>Lewis</li>
