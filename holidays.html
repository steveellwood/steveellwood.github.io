<h1>Key Holidays undertaken</h1>

<h2>Foreign</h2>
	<p>I suppose, largely, foreign is a matter of perspective. From the point of view of two English people, living in Scotland, pretty much
	 anything off mainland UK is what counts. So that's what we'll call them.</p>
	
	<p><a href="nz.html" title="Our New Zealand Holiday">New Zealand</a> was probably our biggest and most impressive holiday. Still by all accounts
	 as wonderful as it was when we visited, and the only country I've ever wanted to emigrate to.</p>
	<p><a href="singaporediary.html" title="Christmas in Singapore">Singapore</a> was almost a <em>whim</em> visit. The <a href="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/men/">M.E.N.</a>, or Manchester Evening news had advertised a holiday "<strong>Christmas at Raffles</strong>", and I thought it sounded expensive.
	We decided to price it up, and found we could get a much better price as solo travellers. So we did.</p>
