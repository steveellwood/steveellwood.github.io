<title>Ellwoods of Cromarty; Work, life, and holidays</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>The Ellwood Family</h1>
<h2>Site Purpose</h2>
<p>This site is about the life and activities of the Ellwood family
of <a href="cromarty.html">Cromarty</a>.</p>
<p><em>A large part of this is Steve's desire to update his 10 year
old knowledge of how websites work. He's not done anything
significant since ooh, about 1995. Since he is editor of the local
website, he thought it might be sensible to understand how HTMl
worked nowadays. Much to his horror, he now finds things called
style sheets and XHTML. He is very pleased that the entire site is
currently handcoded using <a href=
"http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/steveb/cpaap/pfe/default.htm" title=
"Home page for PFE">PFE</a>, but admits to using <a href=
"http://www.nvu.com/" title="Nvu home page">Nvu</a> for some grunt
work. It doesn't do good XHTML though... and needs tidying. This
site is valid - see the box at the bottom</em></p>
<p>We've only been here for three years but like it a great
deal.</p>
<p>We'll provide pictures of the area and the things that interest
us. There will be links to Holiday information, both about where
we've been , and where we recommend.</p>
<div id="holidays">
<h2>Holidays</h2>
<p>At the moment, the only links are to the work in progress of the
1999 <a href="nz.html" title="A 2 week New Zealand Idyll">New
Zealand</a> holiday, the 2000 <a href="singaporediary.html" title=
"Christmas in Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="spanish.html"
title="Spain with kids">Spanish</a> holidays, though the Spanish
one is brief... and the 2001 <a href="hebrides.html" title=
"a fast week in slow islands">Hebridean</a> holiday</p>
</div>
<div id="recommendations">
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>We travel round with three dogs, see below. For most places that
makes you very unwelcome.</p>
<p>In Cromarty, you get a friendly welcome and real ale at the
<a href=
"http://www.go-bedandbreakfast.co.uk/cromartyarms/">Cromarty
Arms</a>, but that's cheating a bit, as we live in Cromarty...</p>
<p>On the West side of Scotland, in Gairloch, you get nice rooms,
good food and real ale at the <a href="http://www.theoldinn.net/"
title="very busy website">Old Inn</a>. <em>Very</em> busy in the
summer, but well worth a visit at anytime.</p>
<p>On Skye, a really nice welcoming hotel is the <a href=
"http://www.uighotel.com/uig_hotel.htm" title=
"Website sadly designed for IE">Uig Hotel</a> - and even their own
duck eggs for breakfast, if you're lucky.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>We moved to Cromarty from Manchester in England in July 2003.
We're both Homeworkers, Steve as an IT Consultant and Estelle
running the Virtual Learning Centre on the Black Isle.</p>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>Steve collects <a href="Knives.html">edged</a> tools; he borrows
them from friends, too. Some are quite <a href=
"./ctaxe.html#axe">large</a>.</p>
<p>He also quite likes outdoorsy stuff, although Estelle suspects
this is because he likes all the kit. You can see a description of
his first night in a <a href="hammock.html" title=
"kipping in a hammock">hammock</a>.</p>
<h2>Pets</h2>
<p>We have 3 dogs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jixy</li>
<li>Zander</li>
<li>Ollie</li>
</ol>
<p>They're pictured here in sun and snow</p>
