<P>I had a Burmese Cat, called Ted; I used to have two; the other one, who was called Josh, had a terminal discussion with a motor vehicle.<BR>
For real cat lovers, there is a 73k picture of the <a href="./images/cats.gif">cats</a>. The squished one is the blue (grey) one on the right.
<P>I also have two <a href="./images/kids.gif">children</a>, Philip (6) and Rowan (4), who are wonderful - note the information free content of that phrase - all parents think their children are wonderful....

I do, however, have a picture of <a href="./images/phil1.gif">an elephant in a storm</a> which was one of Philip's earlier works [grin]. Philip is also learning about <A HREF="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~quinnm/Weather.html">weather</A> at school.<P>

I have been known to drink the odd pint of <A HREF="http://www.camra.org.uk/">beer</A>.
