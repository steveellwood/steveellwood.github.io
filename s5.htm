<P>
I work for <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A> which is a very busy place to work.<BR>
I deal with IT nowadays, but I used to deal a lot with internal reporting, then customer service issues in the past, and have recently assisted at some of our customer events (which I have to say I enjoyed greatly)<BR>
<P>If you have a problem, you can always tell <A HREF="mailto:steve.ellwood@btinternet.com">me</A> about it, and I'll do my best to help, but do remember that this is a <em>personal</em> Web site, and may not be looked at as regularly as I'd like. If your problem requires immediate attention, I'd refer you to our professionals:<BR>
For "residential" customers try 151 for faults, 150 for other queries.<BR>
For "business" customers try 154 for faults, 0800 800 800 for other queries.<P>
By the way, if you wish to flame me for working for BT, or mail abuse to me - don't. It will either get sent to /dev/null or your postmaster.<P>
