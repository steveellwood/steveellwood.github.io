  <title>Ellwood 1999 Holiday in
New Zealand</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Once in a lifetime - to New Zealand (23 October - 6 November 1999)</h1>
<h2>Saturday
&nbsp;23/10/99
8:16</h2>
<p>Ok.At the airport
Painless checkin, good breakfast.
First photos. Plane &amp; Estelle.</p>
<p><img alt="E waiting for plane" src="./images/nz1.jpg" />Good start,
boarding delayed
by
about 45 mins.
Eventually left about 40 mins late.
First champagne at about 10.45.
Lunch 12.00 fish for me , chicken for E.</p>
<p>I watched a video <q>
Wild Wild West</q> -E watched <q>Big
Daddy</q> .
We flew over Amsterdam, Austria, Prague , North
of Iraq, Tehran, and
Karachi. The average altitude was 35000 feet - with an external temp
of&nbsp; -50C. Speed? About
600mph.
</p>
<h2>23/10/99 20:26 </h2>
<p>OK. We've just taken off from
Bombay. We were not allowed off the
plane, which was a bit of a pain.
</p>
<p>Time dragged a little to
Bombay; Estelle slept a bit; I watched 'The
General's daughter' while E watched 'All for Love'. I ate
prawns (and a little more shampoo)
while E ate nothing. </p>
<p>Getting a little weary and
stiff now.
Most people had a kip. E managed the odd half-hour - me a
little less. Sleeping became progressively harder. It came as a relief
when we began our descent into Changi.</p>
<p> That
name has great resonance when you think of the suffering of the
prisoners there. We looked out and
saw literally scores of ships in the Malacca Straits - tankers,
freighters, lighters, fishing boats - I
can't recall ever seeing more ships in one place - including HK
harbour...</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have long
in SG - barely long enough for a pee!
(Estelle told me the next day she had time to clean her teeth and
change her knickers, too!)Total time walking round
the airport probably less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>We went to board the Air New
Zealand flight - and it was a 767
, or as Estelle said, 'a little plane' . The high point for Estelle was
that she only has to move me if
she wants to go the bog.
</p>
<h2>Sunday 24/10/99 11:54 </h2>
<p>Well-we're here. We were some
50 mins early. It amuses me to see a sign
that says vision deliver the best customs experience in the
Pacific-when 200 of us have queued for
25-mins for 2 immigration officers. Of course, Aussies/Kiwis have 2 to
themselves.!
After that somewhat grumpy entry, it's only fair to say that the rest
of the experience wasn't so bad. </p>
<p>Straight through customs -
every bag
checked with X-rays, straight to a
taxi, and straight to the hotel. They were expecting us, and we have a
nice view.</p>
<p>We had a quick coffee, bath -
decided to splash out on breakfast in
bed... and went to sleep.</p>
<h2>Monday24/10/99 20:33 (except
it's 08:33 on 25/10/1999 here...)</h2>
<p>Morning brought bright sunshine
and a stunning view of the harbour. We
didn't expect to be awake for 7.30, but we are, and we're now
impatiently waiting for our breakfast.</p>
<p>Estelle has still got a nasty
sore throat, so we'll have to find a
chemist later. Glancing at the TV, I
found 4 channels showing sport (All Blacks beat Scotland 30:18) England
lost to the 'boks.</p>
<p>Breakfast arrived on time
(early, in fact 9.06) and was OK. Estelle
made a point of having hers in bed, looking out at sun, sea, boat's
masts and hills.</p>
<p>I had yoghurt and prunes - she
had cornies - then cooked breakfasts.</p>
<h2>25/10/99 </h2>
<p>(actually, it's about 9.20 am
on the 26/10/1999 here, but
who's counting)
</p>
<p>Time for a further update, I
suppose.
</p>
<p>Estelle is a bit poorly today,
and had to start on my antibiotics last
night. I've just been out to the pharmacy and got her lozenges, throat
spray and cough medicine. So,
while she's coughing away, I'll update what we did yesterday.
</p>
<p>We had a quick walk round while
waiting for the car to be
delivered, and looked at the various ferry round the harbour options.
We had a drink, and then went for
a walk round the America's Cup village. Amazing. Millions of dollars
being spent to win a silver trophy - and I
don't mean small numbers of millions, and I don't mean NZ dollars.</p>
<p>We wanted to go for a coffee,
so quite typically, we went to
a museum - the New Zealand Maritime Museum. We arrived just in time to
go for a ride on the harbour on the
good ship Ted Ashby - a recreation of a traditional NZ scow. They took
us round the boats -
impressive - and then under the harbour bridge - which is actually 3
bridges - the first 4 lane bridge
being too small, they decided to enlarge it. They had two extra 2 lane
bits made - in Japan - brought
over here on a special ship, and then attached to the sides of the
existing bridge. Very High tech - and
hence the nickname of the Nippon Clipon. I liked it any way. </p>
<p>We had a
wander round in the museum, lots
of different types of canoes, some "oral tradition" chairs where I
listened to a whaler from the 50's
and 60's talk. He said he'd not kill whales nowadays - but "the way we
whaled would not have depleted the
stocks". Terrible way to refer to those magnificent animals. We saw a
mockup of an old
immigrant ship (which actually rolled - as if it was at sea) which was
quite impressive. </p>
<p>We got fairly peckish but
thought the harbourside cafe looked a bit tourist trappy. So, we went
for a walk - after Estelle
worked some magic. </p>
<p>On the way out of the museum, I
realised I'd mislaid
my sunglasses, which I like. So, we
had to walk through the museum - which is on two levels in three
buildings. On the way
through the second (canoe) hall Estelle suddenly said, "I remember
hearing a noise in this corner"
and peered over the edge of a walkway. Beneath one of the exhibits were
my glasses. I clambered down and
retrieved them , attracting the odd suspicious look from a curator. I'm
sure she must be a witch...</p>
<p>When we walked off for a meal,
I found us a food court - basically it
had 15 little fast food outlets - no, not McDonalds -
Korean/Indian/Chinese/Malaysian/Singaporean/Turkish/Italian eating
places. We had wonton &amp; bbq pork soup/Thai fried noodles with
pork (I do love
cut and paste from our accounts records). </p>
<p>We then went for a beer in
Shakespeare's - not too bad really
- and went back to the hotel for a kip. </p>
<p>We overslept, but dressed
hurriedly, and made it to the Skytower
restaurant for our 9.00 reservation. </p>
<p>What? I didn't mention that?
Oh,
we went for a meal 190.5
metres(about 619 feet) up in the sky in a revolving restaurant.</p>
<p>Outstanding. </p>
<p>Absolutely
unbelievable. </p>
<p>The bill was about
&pound;60 for 3 courses + wine,
beer and coffee. It would have cost
&pound;10 just to go to the observation deck for the 2 of us. </p>
<p>The
food was good and the moon over Auckland was superb - watching
ships go out....</p>
<p>We walked round the shops a bit
on the way back - before I had to dash
back for the loo!</p>
<p>That was last night. The end of
a brilliant sunny Labour Day (about
24C).</p>
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<p>This morning I've been for a
coffee, rung my Mum and dosed Estelle with
medicine, and remembered to book the hotel for a week on Friday - now
to checkout, and get some
breakfast.</p>
<h2>26/10/99 (actually Wednesday
27/10 here)</h2>
<p>We managed to get up late in
the morning - and get out for breakfast.
Estelle was a bit crook, but came for a walk after checkout - we went
and had breakfast at a place called
<q>serious about coffee</q>
- the breakfast <q>sausage inna
bun</q> wasn't bad,
but the coffee I had was
execrable.</p>
<p>We wandered round the downtown
shopping centre - and we were jointly
unable to resist the sushi - we watched them making it, and bought
three lunchboxes of sushi - it cost
a whole &pound;6.
</p>
<p>We drove out on the busy
Southern motorway. Busy? Not hardly.
Less traffic than morning suburban rush hour in Manchester. Within an
hour or so we were well on the way
to Hamilton. It's noticeable how far the business spread out on their
lots - Estelle said -
correctly I think - that it looked very American the way the businesses
look like shacks spread out beside the
road. Estelle dozed in the car - in itself a sign that she wasn't well.</p>
<p>The overriding impression was
that NZ is a place that is green and full of rivers. The motorway
turned into the Southern Highway - much of
it 2 lane (reminiscent of bits of the A9 in Scotland). Estelle looked
at the houses - and commented on
how unusual it was to have your house built for you - and then taken to
where you wanted it; house
removals being an accurate description of what she saw.</p>
<p>As we were driving beside the
Waikato River I kept missing places to
stop until - we reached Ngawhana(sp?). We sat beside the river in a
picnic area (of which we
have the photos) and ate our Sushi. It was very pretty, and after we
had used the automated
loo(free, note) we set off on the road again - into the light drizzle.
The last thing we saw as we drove off
into the rain was a speedboat towing a water-skier at a smart clip up
the river - try that on the Irwell!</p>
<p>Estelle dozed some more as we
drove through the forests - a
"very windy road" as Estelle mumbled in her sleep. I did have to avoid
a piece of timber falling off a lorry
but the rest of the drive passed without incident. I drove past some
tourist attractions but didn't wake
Estelle, until I saw some steam beside the road - yes, it was.</p>
<p>We went for a walk in the
little thermal area. It's hard to describe
what it was like. The smell is noticeable but not bad, however, it is
amazing watching boiling mud
beside the path, and steam escaping from the ground. We touched some of
the water - truly just off
boiling. The larger pools were covered in steam - it looked very
spooky. The last thing I noticed was
that the actual grass was warm with the activity beneath it.</p>
<p>We went into Rotorua itself and
found a motel to stay in. Accommodation
is abundant; and cheap - we paid about &pound;10 a night. We tried
to book for a Maori event
and hangi (traditional Maori dinner) but couldn't get in - so, on the
spur of the moment we decided to
book an extra night.</p>
<p>So, the rest of the evening was
at leisure. We had
a cup of tea/coffee (milk provided by
the landlady) and scuttled off to the Polynesian spa. They had talked
on the TV [- ah, that's
right, I've forgotten to mention that Rotorua has a "tourist TV"
station which constantly recommends things to see
and do] about the premium bathing experience - the exclusive spa. We
decided hang the expense
we'd have a go. With the discount vouchers we'd been given it cost us
about &pound;15 to go
in to the spa. [That's right, about &pound;7.50 each]</p>
<p>The place is unbelievable;
solid wood polished floors,
abundant free towels (though to Estelle's chagrin, they were all
green). </p>
<p>You walk out in your cossy to
the first
pool, outside the ladies. It smells a teeny bit sulphurous, and is
pleasantly warm - about blood
heat 38&deg;. You look out over the lake, through the gardens and
see the steaming lake. </p>
<p>Next pool, under cover
is a bit warmer and I nearly fell asleep in it. Estelle wedged herself
with head against one rocky
outcrop, feet against another and dozed a little. </p>
<p>The next pool was
hotter yet - say about 41&deg; - which
was a little challenging. You could swim[just] to the end of the pool
and sit in a little grotto. </p>
<p>The final
pool was extremely hot. I'd guess 45&deg;. Almost too hot to bear.
So, a quick cold shower [for one
of us - the other chickened out] and back to the beginning again.</p>
<p>Through the pools twice more in
about an hour
and a half, and off for a drink.</p>
<p>We went into the Kiwi Spirit
bar [saying in passing that Rotorua at
night - 7.15 p.m. - was practically deserted.] This bar was dark, dull,
sullen and unwelcoming. We stayed
long enough for E to finish her Stella and left (I had two glasses). </p>
<p></p>
<p>We
wandered round and window
shopped a bit on the way to the Pig and Whistle. The contrast couldn't
have been greater. Bright friendly
and
welcoming - we decided to eat there and had ribs/wings and chips
with a couple of beers. So," home"
and bed. We went to sleep at about 9.30.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Wednesday 27/10/99 </h2>
<p>Estelle said she'd had her best
nights sleep for a week.
After another nap we went out for breakfast and found our way to the
Nomads cafe. They advertise they do the best breakfast in New Zealand.
I think they undersell
themselves. It was excellent. (and enormous) </p>
<p>We went off fortified, and
put the first 3 rolls of film in
for developing, and bought some postcards. I've updated this, and E's
writing cards. So, off to the
Thermal reserves.....</p>
<h2>27/10/99 5:22 (of course, that means 17.22)</h2>

<p>We set off, unsure of how far we had to go.. In fact, the next stop was
only about 3k out of town [passing an absolutely inordinate number of
motels - which , as this is
not high season, were offering all sorts of specials.</p><p>
We went to Whaka village or, more properly Whakarewarewa. We were just
in time to join a guided tour through the village. We'd liked the
thermal pools at the entrance
to Rotorua. They were minuscule compared to what we saw here. </p><p>Large
lakes - all boiling - feeding
boiling mud pools - 50-foot deep boiling pools - used for washing and
cooking vegetables in. Communal
baths - too hot to put your hands in. We went to the village hall or
Wahiao (sacred meeting house, where
we heard some of the chants and songs. We watched amazed as the poi
dancing went on. Very graceful,
involving swinging two balls on the ends of cords in time to the music.
A traditional stick
dance followed - and to my amazement, only one stick was dropped. I
would have expected more with
the speed of the stick exchanges. </p><p>The dancers wore the piupiu, or
swinging skirt - made of
flax, patterned by having pieces of outer leaf scraped free, lengths of
base stripped to fibre and then
treated in the hot pools and dyed in natural materials. They end up
like beaded skirts, and our guide [who'd
learnt to make them under the tutelage of his grandmother] said they
were possibly the most
uncomfortable garments imaginable to wear. </p><p>To his embarrassment,
earlier in the tour, his grandmother had
called to him in front of the entire group. The piupiu was only
invented this century as a dancing/show
garment - being too cold and impractical for wear elsewhere.</p><p>
After the show, we returned bast the boiling lakes and the mud pools to
admire the geysers. They were quite splendid, and rather frightening
even from the distance we saw
them.</p><p>
On the way out, we stopped to eat some sweetcorn, cooked in the main
cooking pool. It was very tender - and did taste very sweet. Also
noticeable was how hard one of the
underground cooking areas was boiling. A mini geyser was moving the top
off with boiling mud and
water spraying 3 or 4 feet into the air. I overheard one of the Maori
villagers saying "We need to get that
fenced off - we can't have the tourist getting burned" [That reminded
me of what the owner of the
Nomads cafe had said was used to set off the Lady Knox geyser at 10.15
every day. "Oh, they just chuck
in an Aussie tourist"]</p><p>
We made our way from the village - encumbered by my walking stick -
yes, I bought one - and drove back to Rotorua. On the way out we
chucked coins to two children diving
for coins in the river - an old tradition apparently. Quick coffee,
picked up the photos, posted some cards and back to the
motel for a rest before the rest of the day.</p>
<h2>28/10/99 </h2>
<p>Ok, it's 10pm and I've got loads to catch up.</p><p>
Estelle needed a nap before we went to the Maori cultural event and
"hangi" or earth cooked banquet.</p><p>
We were being picked up by coach between 6.30 and 6.45. By the time we
had had a drink and tidied up it was already something like 17.50.
She'd said she wanted at least 20 minutes sleep. I woke her at 6.25.
Unfortunately, the bus arrived almost immediately. </p><p>For the next
30 minutes I was treated to a major grump about how bad I was for not
waking her. The coach took us
to the booking centre, where we paid, and I grabbed a beer. Our coach
driver Ngata (pronounced
nutter - as he told us how to remember it by twirling his finger by his
temple) briefed us on what to
expect at the village - and told us to remember bus number 91 - or
2590. 2590? </p><p>Yes, a $25.90 taxi fare back
if you got on the wrong bus.</p><p> A "rwatingi" or chief was appointed by the
drive before we arrived at
the village. When we got there, we stood around the square in silence,
before a mysterious whirring
sound [not all that mysterious - I recognised the bullroarer of old].</p><p> A
Maori warrior rushed out to give a
ritual challenge; - we were then invited into the village - we saw
recreations of Maori life from the
early 14th century - poi dancing, Maori chanting, flute playing, stick
fighting, hand games and so on.</p><p>
Having looked at that for some time we were invited into the meeting
house - where we listened to
[lengthy] welcoming speeches - in Maori. We then had a bit of a chat
about how they were keeping Maori
culture alive. I observed to Estelle that a large part of Maori culture
seemed to be the ritual
slaughter of enemies, other tribes or anyone else that took their
fancy. Head taking and cannibalism weren't
ruled out, nor the use of enemies bones for tool making.</p><p> While we heard
about the 7 canoes of the
Maori ancestor arriving - we heard little about what happened to anyone
here before the
Maoris. Perhaps this is not the best thing to raise with them...</p><p>
We saw the cultural display, including use of that traditional Maori
instrument - the guitar - explained as "one of their elders brought
this to them, to help in recalling
Maori history"</p><p>
The dances were graceful - as poi is, the haka (war gesture dance) was
impressive as haka are - and so it went.</p><p>
I thought the Maori cultural references were a bit heavy...</p><p>
Anyway, we went for our meal, a "hangi" cooked in earth ovens on top of
white-hot stones covered in hessian. A very characteristic flavour to
all the food - which was
tender and smoky. Estelle said that she would not rush to have it
again.</p><p>
We were shown lots of "traditional Maori merchandise" which we
successfully avoided buying with "traditional NZ dollars"</p><p>
After a quick burst of song and a haka from the drivers we made our way
home by coach. Not without incident though. The driver insisted that
each country had to sing a
song, or he'd stop the bus. Unsurprisingly, when he got to the Brits,
no one would sing - till he
actually stopped the bus and turned out the lights. Ten some
long-suffering woman sang Nellie Dean - so we
could go on.</p><p>
After he and 2 of his cohorts played buses ring around the roundabout
he dropped us all at our hotels - Estelle and I last of all. Every
single person got a hongi or
traditional Maori nose rub as we got off the bus.
That was Wednesday. Right I'll finish there - again a day behind. My
Jacuzzi awaits....</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p>OK, where did I get to - right, we got up on Thursday morning, and made
sure we got tidied away - we went off for breakfast - getting lost in
Rotorua before we could find
the Nomads cafe.</p><p> Estelle was hungry, tucking into pancakes with lemon
and sugar - together with a
glass of *very* sharp Kiwi fruit juice. I had the same pancakes, but
with bacon and raisin toast.</p><p>
Failing miserably to do my email, we walked round to the film shop
after paying for our ferry crossing
tomorrow. (We even got discount for booking in advance.)
We then went back to the motel and left - saying bye bye to Rotorua.</p><p>
Everywhere is so green. The green of the trees matched the green of the
hills - quite stunning to see.</p><p>
On the way to Taupo, we stopped at the Huka falls. This is a channel
connected with the immensely successful hydroelectric schemes in NZ.
The water was channelled about
4m wide and 10m deep. It was so clear and blue it looked like swimming
pool water. It is the Kiwi's
proud boast that you can drink any of their open water - this certainly
looked like it.<em> It should be added that this is no longer the case, and apparently wasn't even in 1999</em></p><p>
We drove past Lake Taupo - NZ's largest lake. - it is truly enormous
-but a little featureless. We were glad we had decided not to stay
there. After
driving for what seemed like hours, we decided to stop for a coffee.</p><p>
The next place we came to was called Turangi. We drew up and
parked - coincidentally outside a cafe. (It was also a bakery with a
wide range of home baked
pies and cakes). They were excellent. </p><p>However, I could have done
without the door-warning device.
It sounded like a bird chirping, and I spent about10 minutes looking
for the cage before Estelle told me.</p><p>
The drive on became wetter and more drizzly. We drove on and climbed -
into more cloud and drizzle - and were amused to see we were heading
for the Rangipo desert. So onto
the desert road - like moors-
but tropical bushes and palms. We drove through clouds, and saw how
heavily the countryside had been glaciated. There were knife-edge
ridges, steep valleys, and drumlins.
The road was nearly all 2 lane with passing places. We drove through
the clouds.</p><p>
As we descended, we noticed how many of the farms grew different
things, some blueberries, and some asparagus. There were loads of
roadside stalls selling bits and bobs-
strawberries, fruit and veges-even daffodils...
We even spotted a llama!</p><p>
An uneventful drive then till we got to Bulls - a roadside cafe with
the lovely name of the Horny Cow. We got there at 2.55 - it was open
till 3pm and were greeted with "Oh,
no..."
Reluctantly the owner served us both with coffee. It was cheap - but
vastly overpriced for its abysmal quality. Still, they had a nice cat
and dog , and a pretty garden.</p><p>
We drove on for anther hour or so till we hit [shock, horror] the
Wellington motorway. This is not busy - even in their rush hour. We
found our way straight to the car hire
place and Estelle spotted a motel over the road from it. It took us
about 10 minutes to make our way back
to it past the ... err... exotic surroundings (it backed onto the red
light area, such as that is in
Wellington[not very naughty])</p><p>
The motel was absolutely amazing. Clean, bedroom, living rooms, kitchen
and bathroom with Jacuzzi. Milk, beer and orange juice provided, no
deposit requested and it
was... &pound;45.</p><p>
We got showered and changed and looked in the guidebook for where to
eat. We fancied seafood, so reserved at "Shed 5". We walked down to
Wellington itself -
about 5 -10 minutes walk, found the restaurant and stopped for a beer
next door.</p><p>
Estelle got her fish and sweet potato chowder - followed by an enormous
helping of whitebait. I had sushi (again) with sashimi followed by a
seafood medley. We finished
off with an espresso, and walked back to the motel, window-shopping as
we went. When we got back to the
motel, we had a Jacuzzi.</p>
<h2>Friday 29/10/99</h2>
<p>We paid up, and took the car over the road and waited and waited for
the guy from the rental company. It rained buckets - just to make us
feel at home. </p><p>When he arrived
eventually we followed him to the ferry terminal about 10 minutes drive
away. The ferry operation was
reasonably slick, with all the bags having to be checked in. After a
bit of a delay we boarded the ferry,
finding seats near the front. </p><p>We got a breakfast of sorts - cheap, but
nasty - and went for a walk on deck -
which was blowy.</p><p>
The rest of the crossing proved uneventful, until we arrived at the
South Island. The Marlborough Sounds were amazing, and the narrow
channels were truly impressive.</p><p>
We docked at Picton, and got off the ferry - last of all the
passengers. We picked up the baggage easily enough, and then went to
get the rental car. After a minute or two's
delay, we got the car and were able to set off.</p><p>
We drove for a few miles south through amazing countryside. Really
heavily glaciated, but very little traffic and it was warm. We stopped
for a bite to
eat - sandwich and beans on toast at a petrol station - where
interestingly enough there were loads of teatowels and prints of
Yorkshire. We managed to get the whale watch booked for tomorrow, which
was good.</p><p>
It's obvious that the rivers flood heavily here, as we passed several
ford areas, which actually have gates and bridges to allow diversions.
The scenery is indescribable. High snow covered mountains thrusting
their way into the clouds. Vertiginous cliffs coming down to the sea.</p><p>
We stopped at Oahu lookout
point, and to our amazement the rocks were *covered* with seals. Really
undisturbed by all these
gawping humans.</p><p>
The sight of mountains climbing down to the sea was impressive, but we
were amused to see the railway line and the road swapping sides
frequently.</p><p>
We have seen loads of venison farms - evidently the South Island
farmers diversify too.</p><p>
Lots of fishermen getting crayfish and lobsters and vans selling
them...</p><p>
We'd booked for whale watching while we were at the cafe, so there was
no rush for Kaikoura. When we got there, we drove down to see where the
whale centre was - and
decide to look for a motel close by. We found one at the end of the
road. We got settled in, had a
coffee, and went out for a beer and to find something to eat.</p><p>
Kaikoura is a simply amazing place. The mountains behind it are
enormous 6-8 thousand feet high, and covered in snow at the top. They
form a bowl round the
harbour and look beautiful. </p><p>The main drag is pretty simple - a few bars
and cafes.
We went for a beer, and after a brief peruse of the first menu, we
decided we had to have Crayfish - as that is what Kaikoura is named
after.</p><p>
We went to a different restaurant - the Olive Branch - which was
absolutely beautiful inside - yellow walls, beautiful glass bowl
lights, and arty nude prints on the wall.
Estelle liked it 'cos the loo (for the ladies) had little individual
hand flannels in a wicker drawer set.</p><p>
We had a beer, then ordered. We started with a dozen oysters - a first
for Estelle - and then had a dozen green lipped mussels. We then both
had crayfish - which was great. We
had a walk on the beach and went back to the motel.</p>
<h2>Saturday 30/10/1999</h2>
<p>Morning. Mounting excitement. We went into Kaikoura for breakfast - we
had a little at a cafe. Estelle had a cheese and ham toastie, and I had
a little omelette. And hash
browns. OK, it was an absolutely enormous souffl&eacute; omelette
loaded with ham, cheese and
mushrooms.</p><p>
Unfortunately the day went down hill from there. The whale trip was
cancelled, so we booked for 15:00. </p><p>We went for a drive and saw the
viewpoint of the Old customs
house. Behind us was the Fyffe house, built on whalebone piles. We had
a tour through that by the
deputy curator. He was another UK emigrant.</p><p>
After that we went to the seal colony. We'd though the seals were close
at Oahu. Wrong. We were within say 20 feet of them. Estelle had a
little paddle - and assured
me that the South pacific is, in fact, quite cold.</p><p>
We then walked up to the cliff top. The sunshine was brilliant -
sufficiently hot to burn my head. The view was overwhelming - bright
sunshine, palm trees, blue sea, seals,
and tall snow covered mountains.</p><p>
We went back to Kaikoura and looked round for some lunch. We had fried
groper, with chips - potato for Estelle and kumara, or sweet potato for
me.</p><p>
Back to the Whale Watch. Nope, still cancelled. We had a swift coffee,
and decided to book for the early morning trip. We got that sorted.</p><p>
Before we headed back
to the motel from the day before, we decided to go for a mountain
drive. It was absolutely amazing. The
hills were yellow with broom and gorse, with clouds moving between the
peaks. We drove miles into the
mountains along the winding roads over dry river beds - past loads of
signs warning of cyanide bait
down for possum control [not very green really...], until we got to the
gravel road.... which went
on for another 30 miles, so we decided to turn back.</p><p>
We got into the motel again - a 6-bedded unit - for about
&pound;26. We decided to be virtuous and do the washing - two
machine loads - so back into Kaikoura for washing powder
(and we bought wine and chocs too. - Liquorice chocolate by Cadburys
for Estelle, and hokey
pokey [like Crunchie] for me.</p><p>
While Estelle concentrated on the laundry I captured some
Z&rsquo;s. After being disturbed by a really loud public siren -
which we guess alerted volunteer fire brigades - I got
up. I went to get pizza for tea, which we ate with a nice bottle of
wine.</p><p>
After tea, I was highly depressed to find I'd deleted a day
and a half of diary. I've just finished updating it - and am going to
crash out for our 5 am start.</p>
<h2>Sunday 31/10/1999</h2>
<p>I woke with a start at 4.30 am - panicked in case we'd missed the boat.
That woke Estelle, and while I managed to go back to sleep for half an
hour or so - she didn't. </p><p>At
5.15 I went down to the Whaleway station (so called because it used to
be the railway station) - and
asked if the boat was one. They said they were waiting to find out and
could I hang on. A minute or two
later, the boat captain came in and said the trip was marginal - but
he'd give it a go. All stations go -
back to pick up Estelle, a quick slurp of tea and we were off, just as
it was going light. </p><p>No mountains to be
seen this morning - they were all shrouded in clouds.
Went down, paid; we were warned that seasickness precautions might be
necessary - so we rented accupressure bands - then watched a quick
safety video, on
the bus at about 6.10, down to the boat at South Bay.</p><p>
The boat was on a trailer - waiting for us to board - a bit odd we
thought. First bad sign. This was a jet boat. Hmm. It was a Cougar and
could carry up to 50 passengers. Not so
many masochists this morning.</p><p>
We set off, to a most amusing briefing. We wee warned it might be a bit
bumpy, and to put on our seatbelts. No, there weren't any. Estelle, for
reasons best known to
herself, decided after hearing that there would be less bumps at the
back to sit at the front. We sat
further forward than anyone else - and sat sideways. Great.</p><p>
We set off, the boat went very quickly, and it started to get bumpy.
The guide then announced that this was mild, and that the engines
hadn't warmed up yet - when they did, we
would be doing 30 knots. Great, again.</p><p>
The only thing that significantly cheered me up was when he said that
we should not attempt to swim home, as this sea was a bad place for
those who didn't like sharks.
Three out of the top 10 man-eaters were found in these waters - the
Great White being common. That
quietened Estelle down a bit.</p><p>
The sea got progressively heavier, bouncing both Estelle and I out of
our seats. At times the front end of the boat - yes, where we were
sitting - was going up and down about 10
feet.</p><p>
We were told that we were the "whalehunter" boat and would be spotting
whales for all the other boats, planes, and helicopters. We were told
what to look out for - but all
Estelle and I saw were a couple of little dolphins. A couple of
albatrosses were seen flying low over the
sea, then the boat stopped for the crew to use hydrophones to listen
for whales. The second time
they did, we had success.</p><p>
We came upon a sperm whale resting on the water at 7.20 a.m. They are
big. the boat got within about 20 feet of him, and we could see and
hear him spouting. We were warned
when he was about to dive and we all tried to get the "tailshot". </p><p>The
guide then announced there
was a bit of a blow &ndash; another whale had been detected and we
had to go and find him - he dived before
we got there but we soon found another whale. 7.35 - we got to view him
from the top deck,
Estelle and I going up the back companionway while the boat was still
moving at pace.</p><p>
Quite nerve wracking but Estelle did it very nimbly. Back downstairs,
and we were soon onto our third whale at 7.40. We watched him from the
open downstairs windows, and
were able to see how long he was quite closely from the window - he was
up for quite a long time -
we could see the length of him clearly and he dived beautifully. They
go down about 50 metres in the
first 3 seconds.
(all the whales at Kaikoura are male [we'd also helpfully
been told that they are carnivorous, can surface within 6 feet of the
boats, capable of swallowing a 4 metre
shark in one go, and have been know to ram boats])</p><p>
The guides then decided that we had seen enough whales, and told us we
were off to find dusky dolphins.[These allegedly mate up to 8 times a
day, which the guide
said explained why they had a permanent grin, and could be frequently
seen turning somersaults.]</p><p>
We quickly found these, and they performed up to expectations,
including tracking underneath the boat and popping up along side it.
We probably saw 15-20 dolphins.</p><p>
I was glad of anything to take my mind off the sea, as I was not 100%
fit. Madam, of course, was fine - and kept herself amused by telling me
to cover my mouth when I was
yawning with incipient nausea. Most helpful.</p><p>
The weather was very cold with a stiff breeze, and many people were
shivering. I, however, was wearing my Swann Dri jacket, which I had
bought the previous day. As I
told Estelle 1 or 8 times I was lovely and warm. And very visible, due
to its red and black checks.</p><p>
We set of back to South Bay harbour, and were quite surprised to be
driven straight onto the trailer and immediately pulled out of the
water by tractor.</p><p>
From there, back to the motel for half an hours kip. Then back to the
Aroma cafe for breakfast (egg and bacon/hash brown for me - cheese and
ham toastie for Estelle).</p><p>
Then off for a long drive... down SH 1 towards Christchurch.
The drive was through farming country - the most remarkable feature of
which was enormous hedges of alpine -
like leylandii - which where neatly clipped into box shapes - we assume
for shelter for stock. These
were 12-15 feet high, and could run for scores of yards.</p><p>
Everywhere is still green if a little cloudy - this morning in Kaikoura
we had been unable to see the mountaintops when we got up.
Cattle deer and sheep were common - for some reason many of the fields
had bulls in them - breeding season, and less use of A.I. perhaps. </p><p>We
crossed huge dry river beds -
these are up to 100 yards or so wide and it seems inconceivable that
they could fill with water - at
Waiau and Huruni rivers most bridges being one lane bridges. The roads
were fast however.</p><p>
We turned right onto the Highway 73 at Rangiora, stopping for lunch at
Springfield, where we had pies and coffee. The towns we passed through
were mostly quiet, and had the
same look of "roadside shacks" we'd become used to.</p><p>
We started the ascent. We drove alongside mountains, passing ski areas,
all now closed for the season, but could see the enormous snow capped
peaks in the middle distance.</p><p>
We stopped to take photographs where we had high snowy mountains on one
side and forest on the other. It was noticeable how within 20 k's you
could go from Lake
District bare scree type hills, to snow covered mountains, to moor and
rain forest.</p><p> It amused to see
the large silver ferns and the odd palm tree sticking out every now and
again. We continued towards Arthur's
pass. Drizzle started, and the clouds began to come down - you could
see them coming down the
mountains towards us.</p><p>
The roads became more winding, the drizzle began and the clouds came
down. The roads were hairpin after hairpin - Estelle said hair-raising
- but then she has some, I
suppose - and you could see cloud between the hillsides in the valleys.</p><p>
These mountains were entirely
covered in forest - big deciduous trees as far up the mountains as you
could see. </p><p>We came to an area
where there were roadworks for a new viaduct - and that was very, very
hairy descending. We stopped at
the bottom of that descent - after all, if somewhere is called Death
Bend lookout it seems churlish not to
look out - and were amazed to see cheeky mountain parrots walking all
over the car park. (We also
found out what the NZ government has against possums - they were
introduced from Australia, and eat the
native trees.)</p><p>
The heavens then opened. We drove past major waterfalls down hills as
we continued our descent to the coast. The rain forest is truly named,
but still very impressive. </p><p>We
reached the coast after the only boring driving bit - about 15 minutes
between two solid phalanxes of
trees. </p><p>The sea, under the grey sky looked very menacing with the surf
breaking. We drove along the coast
for a bit. All the way through the passes we had been playing tag with
the train lines, first one side
then the other. At Arahura, we came to a one lane bridge - "ha seen
loads of those I thought" I nearly
got myself got totalled by an oncoming car - and when I went onto the bridge, I
was horrified to find that it
was also a railway bridge too. </p><p>Yes, that's right one lane bridge for
traffic and trains from both
directions. Fun or what?</p><p>
Past sundry dying looking coastal towns to Hokitika, which looked like
a bit of a ghost town. We drove round a bit, and found a wonderful
motel, which was really nicely
equipped.</p><p>
We walked back into town to get a beer; the pub was (or looked like it
was) untouched from the 60's. It was fairly disgusting, but it had a
nice dog and a super affectionate
cat who looked a bit like Josh the cat.</p><p>
Time for food, we thought we'd try for the wonderful sounding Tasman
View restaurant - open daily. Except not today. Ah well, no bother - to
the Cafe de Paris.</p><p> After
about 5 minutes, they conceded that they had noticed us, and suggested
relatively politely that we come
back later. </p><p>We didn't really see we had many alternatives as nearly
every where else had shut.</p><p>
We went for a walk down by the front, and we could see the sea
belting in. We walked down by the river, which was beginning to spate
and thought how dangerous the
channel looked where the outgoing river and incoming tide met. The
information boards told us we were
right.</p><p>
Hokitika used to be a gold rush town and was the busiest port in NZ.
They averaged one shipwreck every 10 weeks for a long while - all in
the treacherous river
moorings. The town declined as gold was lost - so it was a true ghost
town.</p><p>
We went for the meal, and were eventually found a table. The service
was truly indifferent. The food was truly exceptional. We both had
exceptional seafood chowder to
start, and then I had rare venison, and Estelle had wild pig casserole.
Probably the best food we have had
in New Zealand - better than the Sky Tower in Auckland or even Shed 5
in Wellington. The
vegetables included three sorts of cabbage finely shredded and briefly
fried - very tasty. (Kumara again, as well)
After some more nasty coffee - why do they wreck it so - back to the
motel.</p><p>
The shower had no cubicle as such - the whole floor draining to a
central drain. Fun.</p>
<h2>Monday</h2>
<p>We both slept well till about 8.30 - and then found out the All Blacks
had lost to France - quelle domage!</p><p>
Paid up - off for a toastie for breakfast (my e&amp;b was good -
E&rsquo;s ham and cheese had cheese unmelted).
We got some pies for lunch, and did a little provision shopping in a
supermarket. Hokitika was misty, drizzly and after we'd experienced how
spooky it was the previous night
we were not disappointed to be going.</p>
<h2>1/11/1999</h2>
<p>On our way out of Hokitika,</p><p>
The rain continues to belt down. We passed any similar ghost town
looking places - obviously in a bit of decline and saw high hills
covered in trees and ferns - with much
water flowing down the hills.</p><p>
We saw some of these wide empty riverbeds. </p><p>Empty no longer with huge
spates of rushing water - many of them quite frightening e.g. Waitaha
and Wanganui rivers. We saw some
recreation sites in the parks - and Lake Ianthe had a long drop toilet
in it (which intimidated Estelle
a bit) and a set of picnic tables, half under water. </p><p>The next big site,
Lake Mapourika had the directions
sign half under water. This rain was causing some big time flooding. </p><p>We
came through Franz Josef Glacier
village and decide to go up to the glacier itself - that road was
closed, and the bridge
out of town was nearly covered in water - we decided to press on to Fox
Glacier. </p><p>This was a very hairy road - water
rushing down all the creeks, warnings about road washouts, many
waterfalls and constant driving rain.</p><p>
We got to Fox Glacier village and needed to find somewhere to stay. Fox
Lodge - offered us a room with private spa bath. Very expensive - about
&pound;39.</p><p>
Expensive? It's a standalone pine lodge. It's enormous and very pretty,
with polished wood floors, walls and ceilings - which are very high.
Estelle wasn't keen on the green
bedding and sofas - but liked the rest of it. We ate our pies for lunch
and then read, watched TV and
shared a spa bath. Well you have to pass the time somehow. The rain
lashed down and heavy thunder rolled
overhead. We weren't too frightened though.</p><p>
About 7.30 the rain moderated, and we got out for a walk. We went to
the guide shop, booked for the helicopter flight, which they reckoned
would go in the morning and
bought some souvenirs/presents.</p><p>
We nipped off for a pub meal (E had fish and chips, and I had a
whitebait omelette). We came back to the chalet, and I started to type
up the diary - and after typing for
half an hour, lost it all. Oh Joy.</p><p>
Estelle's now made me a cup of tea, and I shall go to bed.</p>
<h2>Tuesday 2/11/1999</h2>
<p>Ok, woken by Estelle, early this morning - just to be told to take my
Otrivine.</p><p>
We had listened to a very spooky screeching of birds all night. We
discovered this morning that E's guess had been right. They were kea
parrots.</p><p>
Not very helpful sleeping&hellip;Some of this may be to do with us
getting our feet soaked, while making our way down to a glow worm
grotto last night. </p><p>Estelle said, "This is a
stupid idea," just as I went ankle deep in freezing water.</p><p>
We did breakfast in the chalet - muesli, OJ toast and tea/coffee, and
then I went over to see if the flight was on this morning. We could se
the peaks and the sun was shining.</p><p>
"Yes," I was told, "It looks good for later, but we're running about an
hour behind - still come back for
10.10"
We scuttled round, packed up and paid... and there were a few
suspicious looking clouds about. Yes, could well be flights cancelled.</p><p>
Making the best of this we went for a
short walk down the road for half an hour or so.
There was a nice little walk called the Minehaha walk, which takes you
through a rainforest walk. The moss covered trees, and trailing
creepers looked really impressive, and
the deep, tea-coloured pools by the path were mute testimony to the
volume of rain last night. We saw
the sun coming through gaps in the canopy and the trees beneath
steaming in the sun.</p><p>
As we started to walk back to the guide area - yes, it started to rain
again. A cup of coffee, and we were told possibly not worth hanging
about. We got directions so we could at
least see the glacier. A short drive took us to the first viewpoint -
the road to the glacier
itself was closed due to flooding. The glacier looked excellent, so we
drove on to the next car park, for a
walk to another viewing area.</p><p>
The walk down was impressive, with good views of the glacier and many
waterfalls. We heard a roaring noise - first full running creek we
crossed with a little
bridge. As we continued down the hairpin footpath we heard louder
noises. We saw a couple of steel cables coming
up beside the path. Excellent. </p><p>It was a three-plank suspension bridge.
It was over the main meltwater
river, which was astoundingly fast flowing. Large boulders, and
enormous chunks of ice were going
down stream. Huge stopper waves were on either side. Estelle, very
bravely I thought, came over holding
my hand. The bridge was very wobbly. After a couple of photos we made
our way back. We could see
them still working on the road on the other side of the river.</p><p>
Back to the township. No, still no flights, so we got some postcards
and wrote them while having a very nice antipasto lunch in the Cafe
Neve.</p><p>
Apparently, there might be flights in an hour or so. E and I decided on
a little drive down to Franz Josef to see if any different there.</p>
<h2>2/11/1999</h2>
<p>Franz Josef. What a sickener - same sort of thing - might be helicopter
flights later - but no promises. The pilot of one of the lines went to
have a look up at the mountains.</p><p>
No Joy. However, at least they seemed sad for us.</p><p>
We tried for a plane flight, nope - same thing. Right obviously not
destined to fly, so we might as well head back to Fox.</p><p>
On the way back, on a whim we popped down the glacier access road at
Franz Josef. The terminal face was closed, but we were able to get to
the car park and walk up to
Sentinel rock for a closer look at the glacier. The walk was a good
hard slog - but at least uphill all the
way - so we got a walk down . We were considerably closer than at Fox,
and got a good view of the Ice
cave at the face. On from there, back to Fox..</p><p>
We tried a last time for a flight - that was no go - so we go(ed)</p><p>
We decided to head for Queenstown - we left at 3pm and the drive was
meant to be 7 hours 40 so we anticipated stopping somewhere like
Wanaka.</p><p>
We made quick progress in glorious sunshine and blue skies - ironic as
the weather was too cloudy at the glaciers to fly - but only over the
glaciers themselves.</p><p>
We stopped for coffee at Lake Paranga - where E got changed and feasted
on a banana. I chatted to the owner about logging and Maori politics
much to her pleasure ( I
evidently agreed with her prejudices).</p><p>
The lake was large and surrounded by high tree covered mountains.
We drove on to Knight Point, which was a very high viewpoint out over
the sea - with excellent views, South to the Antarctic and West towards
Tasmania. </p><p>We saw seals on the
beach 700 feet below us, and a Kea wandering about in the car park.</p><p>
We drove onwards, through the Haast valley, which had been excavated by
a trunk glacier, down to the sea - the glacier possibly extending many
miles out to sea. The valley
was half a mile wide in many places, and there where whole uprooted
trees to be seen in the bed of
the river. The valley was surrounded by 6000-foot mountains - many snow
covered.</p><p>
We then stopped at Thunder Creek falls where a 90-foot waterfall
cascaded vertically into the Haast River. The water there was freezing.
We continued on through the Haast pass - with high mountains all
covered top to bottom with tall trees. An unbelievable number of trees.</p><p>
At Lake Makaroa - the land began to turn into scrubby bush - with loads
of yellow gorse and bright green fields. We saw cows (with proper
horns, yet) lots of sheep and
deer again.</p><p>
Lake Wanaka is 26 miles long - and the water was an incredible blue -
most unlike Loch Ness. The mountains were becoming barren, resembling
the Lake District (but
taller)</p><p>
On the turn of a corner we saw majestic mountains rising above Lake
Hawea another immense blue lake.</p><p>
At Waneka we made the decision to carry on, as the road was fast, I was
speeding, and we were making very good progress.
We drove towards Cromwell, passing the Pisa mountain range - noticeable
for its knife-edge ridges and V cut valleys.</p><p>
Many of the fields were full of sheep that looked as if they were made
out of clay. We think it must be the breed and colour. </p><p>The road from
Cromwell to Queenstown was full of
wineries - after we'd done miles of orchards and market gardens. - the
wineries seemed to come
every few hundred yards, offering trips and tastings. We were otherwise
occupied, however.</p><p>
We drove by the side of the Shotover River, and we saw the historic
bridge at Kawarau - where AJ Hacket started the bungy jumping business.
(Estelle says <q>A
headcase...</q>)</p><p>
On approaching Queenstown we saw Lake Wakatipu which is 51 miles long,
3 miles wide at it's widest but only 1300 feet deep. This is surrounded
by mountains - the
Remarkables amongst others - yes, some have snow on them.</p><p>
We had a quick trundle round what looked like a really busy bustling
town (it isn't really - but is huge compared to Fox/Franz Josef) to
find somewhere to stay.</p><p>
We ended up finding a motel, which Estelle had earlier spotted the
other side of, and got a room here. Well, not really a room, a bedroom,
kitchen, living area, bathroom, and
toilet - but we had to pay highly for this. About &pound;33 a
night. This was to be our base of
operations in Queenstown for 3 night. Our longest stay anywhere.</p><p>
The journey only took us 5 and a half hours. Beers all round? Well, off
to find somewhere to eat anyway. Ate at a little Mexican place (with a
few beers) - after a
shaky start when the wrong food was delivered, the meal turned out very
well.</p><p>
A quick walk round a very, very cold Queenstown revealed lots of shops
and things to see then next day. Back to the motel for bath, bed and
sleep - in my case bath,
sleep, bed, sleep.</p>
<h2>Wednesday 3/11/1999</h2>
<p>Woke at 8.10 to a bright sunny morning in Queenstown.</p><p>
The motel - which has a balcony - has a full view of the mountains and
the lake. This is remarkable (pun) for such a reasonable price.</p><p>
After a swift cuppa, off to get milk for breakfast (economical, eh?).
Next a few phone calls - we booked the Milford Sound Fly cruise for 2
p.m., and I decided to confirm the flight from Queenstown to AKL. </p><p>Wow,
bit of a good job we did...
they had changed the flight details and we'd not have got there till
ten past 9. After a bit of a
strop with them, we got reservations for a suitable flight.</p><p>Breakfast
finished ( cereal and
toast), we walked into Queenstown (all of 2 minutes) for a mooch about.</p><p>
We put in 9 films for development (about 274 photos - probably another
hundred today) and then went and looked in a couple of jewellery shops
and then Estelle saw a smutty
T-shirt..... so, of course, she insisted on going into to see the rest
of the wares. </p><p>We ended up buying
the last of our pressies and souvenirs - including a wine block for us.</p><p>
I reckon we went shopping to celebrate that we had booked on the
Shotover Jet. Estelle seemed delighted by this.</p><p>
After shopping we went up on the Skyline gondola to the dizzy heights
of 2500 feet - which is probably 1000 feet or so up from QT. The views
from the cars were staggering -
but E didn't seem that keen when I moved to take piccys. </p><p>From the
viewing decks the views were
unbelievable up each arm of the lake and over to the mountains. As we
looked out, tandem parascenders kept passing overhead. I must admit I
am deeply tempted - more so than by the bungy experience
offered there - down into trees? No thanks. We watched a brief humorous
film called Kiwi Magic, which
showed some spectacular scenery and then went back down the cars to the
motel.</p><p>
After a brief misunderstanding and some 20 minutes delay, a taxi
arrived to take us to Queenstown airport. This is a small airport.
Really small. Probably smaller than
Dundee.</p><p>
We picked up and paid for our tickets ( I quickly grabbed an extra
film) The operation of the fly/cruise was very effective (- straight in
straight on straight off all the way
through).</p><p>
We boarded our massive plane - a 9 passenger Britten Norman Islander
and took off from Queenstown.</p><p>
Flying below, beside and just above snow covered mountains in a tiny
plane is impossible to describe. You are seeing untouched snow from the
winter, valleys that probably no
one has walked in for years - if ever. The peaks seem close enough to
touch - which is a bit worrying
when you are heading straight at them.</p><p>
Loads of mountain lakes that just look shiny blue or green, and many
glacierettes. Sharp edges, trees, rapids, and canyons - you could just
go on for ages.</p><p>
A steep and rather bumpy descent into Milford Sound, and an efficient
bust transfer to the boat - a large and 3/4s empty boat called the
Milford Monarch.</p><p>
Rudyard Kipling apparently called the Sound the eighth wonder of the
world. I don't know about that, but I do know it is one of the most
impressive places that I have ever
seen. Estelle seems to think so too.</p><p>
The fjord is truly magnificent, the sides springing up almost
vertically some thousands of feet. Waterfalls of over 500 feet high.
Overhanging cliffs of over 2000 feet
high (as the guide said, the Empire state wouldn't go more than a third
up) The cliff was far higher
than 2000 feet, incidentally - that was the overhang.</p><p>
We kept going out - past loads more "ooh" making scenery to the Tasman
Sea. Here, you could feel the ocean swell. When the boat turned back,
you could see why the Sound had
been missed by Captain Cook (twice) It completely vanishes from the
sea.</p><p>
As we returned down the Sound, a sharp eyed crewman spotted penguins -
so the boat nearly nosed ashore so we could see them closer.
We passed seals sunning themselves on a high rock, and then benefited
from a cold shower.
The captain took the boat right up to the edge of the Stirling
waterfall. Very bracing.</p><p>
Back to harbour and bus to airport. Another unbelievable flight back.
(Including passing a 1900-foot waterfall, and many more snow covered
mountains. When you look out of
the plane and all you can see are mountains with snow on in every
direction - you know this is an
area of high mountains. It looks like the end of the world.</p><p>
We landed at Queenstown. On a grass strip - which Estelle commented
later felt like a field.
We were both dumbstruck on the way back. It is unbelievably good to see
this place.</p><p>
We updated the diary and watched the clouds coming in with mounting
depression. (well, not really, how could you be depressed after a day
like that - even with a
sunburned bonce).</p>
<h2>3/11/1999</h2>
<p>Well, we decided after the day we had had, we deserved a drink or two,
so off we went in search of a pub.
Estelle and I needed something to eat and drink shortly after we set
off - after all we had just been shopping - buying a real wool duvet to
have airfreighted back to the
UK. We also found a Paua shell for us.</p><p>
New Zealand is not oversupplied with pubs on the whole and Queenstown
is no exception. We made a few circuits and eventually found an Irish
Pub. Pog Mahones... I did
explain to Estelle what Pogue Mahone actually is reputed to mean.</p><p>
We had a couple of beers, and Estelle spotted a guy eating what looked
like half a sheep on some mash. "Interesting," we thought, "we might
have a go at that."</p><p>
We looked at the menu, and it was OK, chicken livers in a whisky cream
sauce on noodles, lamb shanks and ribeye steak on mash ordered with
fresh vegetables. It was really
very tasty - a Guinness after it and we went for a walk.
We came back to the motel and went to sleep. We both slept pretty
solidly.</p>
<h2>Thursday 4/9/1999</h2>
<p>We woke to the buzzy motel alarm, which sounded like the wrath of god.
Estelle kicked me out of bed to make the coffee, so all was not easy
&lt;g&gt;</p><p>
Breakfasted in the motel, and then out to hand in some more films
(about the 18th roll) for developing.</p><p>
Then - to the Shotover Jet base. We were taken from the town base by
bus out to Arthur's point watching a video on the way.
Once at the Shotover canyon base, we were given black rain slickers and
life jackets and we watched the boats hurtling up and down the river.
They looked really fast - as passengers/victims got off the boats, some
were wobbly - many were wet.</p><p>
Estelle and I got on to the back of the boat - and we were warned that
a raised clenched fist meant "Hang on - tighter!"
Estelle didn't understand this as she was already holding on as tight
as she could.</p><p>
These boats are truly crazy - and the drivers are worse -
they tear towards the canyon walls - often literally inches from them.
The boats travel at 40 knots and the water
is sometimes only inches deep. They turn in their own length -
frequently, which is a thrilling and
wet experience.</p><p>
Well, that was quiet. Just time to get back to the motel, buy some
stuff for lunch - and go for some parascending.
Yes, that's right - parascending. You stand on the back of a boat and
get towed up by a parachute.</p><p>
E and I were going to do it tandem at 12:00 - when the boat crew saw
me, they suggested we did it one at a time. E said she didn't want to
do it by herself - but said she'd
consider it.</p><p>
We set off up the lake on the yellow boat, and I was strapped into a
sit harness. The parachute was deployed, and I was attached to it - not
without the odd bit of
difficulty - as we veered from side to side. Shortly, however, I was
being lifted into the air by the chute - a bit
nerve wracking as you lift - but very good views. </p><p>A recurring worry my
shoes were going to fall off, and the
odd creak were the only bad signs. The boat crew let me down quite
close to the water -
which was quite exciting (if I'd known it was an accident, I wouldn't
have thought it exciting - terrifying.)</p><p>
Soon, after I'd stared at the water and mountains and waved
to Estelle a bit - I was hauled in. The creaks didn't matter - I was
back. E decided not to bother.</p><p>
After getting off the boat, we noticed an "Underwater Observatory" on
the jetty. We thought we might get a closer look at the big trout and
eels we'd seen while
we waited to get on the boat.
Yep, we did. There were huge glass windows looking out under the lake -
and little coin operated fish feeders - which, of course, made the fish
swarm round.</p><p>
The fish were immense, rainbow and brown trout up to 20lbs - eels up to
4 or 5 foot long. I took some photos - so we'll see how they turn out.
Oddly enough, we met *another* English emigrant there. He was an ex RAF
man, who came from Hyde and emigrated here in 1970. He was with his
long lost adopted
Chinese brother - who'd been searching for him for 14 years. - and his
niece (?)</p><p>
He said it was likely that immigration restrictions would ease,
following the numbers of young people going to Australia. Interesting,
that.</p><p>
We went back to the motel for lunch - tortellini in two sauces, which I
cooked. I have done all the cooking on this holiday. [Well, I've put
things in the microwave twice
and boiled a pan once] .</p><p> Estelle insists that I point out she has done
breakfast every day [she means
when we've not had breakfast out] - and I'd point out that means madam
has "cooked" toast for 4 days - and
only burnt some of it. Ha - so not much cooking there</p><p>
We rang the helicopter line - yes - flight *was* on.</p><p>
We were collected from the motel, and taken to the airport - I paid and
in minutes we were out to the little 7-seater chopper.
Takeoff was really smooth - but the way a helicopter fly is so
different to a plane. E and I both loved it. We stopped at a spur on
the Remarkables, and the flew round coronet
point, Deer Park [ where a Korean War drama - the Rescue was shot. The
filmset could still be
seen. We then flew over the cable cars circled the town and came back.
That was great, too.</p><p>
Back to the motel, I loafed; Estelle packed. We had a quick brushup and
I shaved. We had a dinner appointment.</p><p>
Estelle and I went on the 6pm dinner cruise of the TSS Earnslaw. This
is an old 1912 steamship that plies up and down the lake. We were taken
to a beautiful old sheep
station (Walter's Peak) where we had a fine dinner - vegetable soup,
roast beef and pavlova -
and a pretty good NZ Pinot Noir wine....</p><p>
We watched sheep dog exhibitions, saw some Border collie puppies - and
I got to ride on (Well, sit on) a Highland Cattle Bull.</p><p>
Back on the steamer - where we all sat round a piano for a singsong on
the way back to QT.
At the motel, I wrote up this diary, and Estelle finished off the
packing.</p>
<h2>Friday 5/11/1999</h2>
<p>Wow - depressing or what.</p><p>
Last day in Queenstown.</p><p>
Fetch E coffee in bed. The day is none too bright, which I suppose
helps a bit.</p><p>
I rang Apex about handing the car in, and was told I could drop it in a
rental bay at the airport. Ring Singapore Airlines - confirm us with an
aisle and centre - after
suffering a bit of call gate hell.</p><p>
We breakfast on cereal and toast - and packed up the
remaining bits and pieces. When you look at all the leaflets we have
gathered - we do seem to have done an awful lot.</p><p>
We went to pay up and said what a nice time we had had. We
took the car out and went to look for somewhere to park - in the end,
we ended up parking by the Kiwi
birdlife centre. (Parking is a bit horrid in town.)</p><p>
In the birdlife centre, the kiwi enclosure is in virtually pitch
blackness. You did have to stay in the enclosure for a bout 10 minutes
before your eyes adapted to the dark.</p><p>
When they did, we were rewarded by the sight of two Kiwis wandering
about in their darkened enclosure.
Their largish bodies and long bill, together with their ungainly walk
made them look like little old men as they wandered round looking for
insects.</p><p>
After 15 minutes or so, we left that enclosure and saw a tui bird [who
very kindly imitated a mobile phone for us] owls, parakeets, teals,
black stilts, NZ wood pigeons,
and two very cute and inquisitive banded rails.</p><p>
We then nipped into town and did our shopping (we ended up parking in
the same place virtually). We collected our films , I bought some nose
spray, and E bought some
horrid pop socks [yeck].</p><p>
We stopped for a very ordinary coffee and exceptionally nice muffin at
this little cafe - which I said seemed a bit women&rsquo;s
collectivey and did a general browse
about. </p><p>After a final walk by the waterfront - where we noticed poetry
written on the wall - and a last look at the
fish, off for lunch.</p><p>
We'd seen this little place called Wraps - which seemed interesting. I
ordered Ragin Cajun [spicy fish] and E had rice, beans and cheese, with
spicy salsa.
We waited ages, and the food was lukewarm when it arrived. E wasn't
convinced she had *any* salsa, never mind spicy.</p><p>
Oh mourning - a last walk round and back to the car. We refuelled it
and set off back to the airport. We were a bit early, so we drove past
and went to the entry for the
Remarkables Ski area. Notes about tyre changes and avalanche control
using explosives caused a wry
smile.
It reminded me of the front of the Phone book we'd seen at Hokitika -
what to do in case of ...
Fire, flood, tidal wave, volcanic eruption and earthquake. Yep,
everyday occurrences in Manchester.</p><p>
The airport when we got there was close to empty. It soon filled - as
three flights were due out - all busy, all delayed.. We dropped the
keys in (to an empty desk) and
checked our bags in.</p><p> After some nerves about the delay, it turned out
we were actually on the same
aircraft out of Christchurch - even though we had to get off for a few
minutes.</p><p>
The flight was OK, about a 15 minute stop in Christchurch and we
arrived in Auckland about three quarters of an hour late. Picked up the
bags - and taxi through to the
hotel.</p><p>
We saw some nice houses as we followed a back road to town, and our
reservation was ready at the hotel.</p><p>
As a "valued customer" we got vouchers for free drinks, but we decided
to go for a walk. We got a beer (or two) at the Shakespeare pub. E's
enjoyment of this was diminished
'cos we were in a pub watching the rugby league final between NZ and
the Aussies. A close match, but
watching it meant we'd missed the food court. After a bit of Mrs.
Grump, we found a bar on the front.
We had a very nice fritto misto, herb bread and risottos. both tasty,
but a bit too herby.</p><p>
Back to the hotel, shower and bed.</p>
<h2>Saturday 6/11/1999</h2>
<p>Day starts OK. Well, last day in NZ, so not so wonderful I suppose.</p><p>
Looked out over the harbour not too bad... then the fog rolled in. I
saw America's Cup boats being
towed out for the challenge. Then the fog clamped right down. </p><p>We had a
last shower and packed up. When we
checked out, we left our bags so we could have a walk about.</p><p>
We went for a rather nice coffee/hot chocolate at Starbucks - 'tho E
had to request butter for her date scone.
We window shopped our way down Queen street - including looks in both
outdoor shops and jewellers, but didn't buy much.
We took a walk down the harbour, admiring all the huge ships -
including a Chines navy comms vessel and an absolutely vast Toyota car
transporter.</p><p>
After that, it was back to check out a lovely alpaca and merino rug
(too big) and hotel for lunch.
Estelle had fish on greens and I had fresh tuna nicoise. How healthy...
- and we drank our free beers.</p><p>
Grabbed our bags and off to the airport. We arrived an hour late for
checkin. This meant we didn't have to wait to long. We bought a few
bottles of water (books for the flight
had been bought in Auckland) and remembered to pick up duty free.</p><p>
Nice seats on the flight from Auckland to SG. Just 2 together . We
companionably watched the Runaway Bride together - and played a bit of
cards. I read. Estelle
read. Hey - what can you say. Meals OK - including a nice little
tournedos, and a bit of shampoo.</p><p>
A draggy wait in Singapore, where we picked up more duty frees. The
flight is packed. A huge queue of sheep waiting to get into the lounge.</p><p>
We just sat and waited. We ended
up boarding our awful, cramped seats right at the back of the 747
without too much delay. Very uncomfortable. Bits of sleep, and nice
Indian veggie meal for me.</p><p>
Usual interminable wait at Mumbai, where I wrote this section of diary
up.</p>
