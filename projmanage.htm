<h1>Why this page?</h1>
<P>Everyone has views about how other people should do their jobs. I'm no 
different. In my work area I deal with projects every day. Every now and then 
someone says something that makes you go:</P>
<blockquote>&quot;Yes, that's really obvious. I wish I'd said that.&quot;</blockquote>
Who was it recently? <A href="#KT">Kevin Turner</A>.
<h1>Background</h1>
<P><a href="http://www.wal-mart.com/">Wal-Mart</a> - the US supermarket chain which is the largest private sector 
employer in the States says that return on investment should be the main driver 
for IT projects. They say their success is due to the way their IT is integrated 
with their business. They have firm views on how you should manage succesful 
IT&nbsp; projects.</P>
<h1>The Tips</h1>
<p><IMG alt=bullet border=0 height=16 src="images/rd_ball.gif" width=17><em>Every project must have an end date:</em><br>Wal-Mart found that projects ran into difficulty because staff did not agree on what had to be achieved by the end date. Turner solved this by pinning the definition on the walls of the IT department.</p>
<p><IMG alt=bullet border=0 height=16 src="images/rd_ball.gif" width=17><em>Eliminate before you automate:</em><br>IT staff must weed out tasks that contribute nothing to the business needs before they start automating anything.</p>
<p><IMG alt=bullet border=0 height=16 src="images/rd_ball.gif" width=17><em>Do the function before the design:</em><BR>Programmers are expected to work on the tills or load lorries so they can be experts in the manual systems they are trying to automate.</p>
<p><IMG alt=bullet border=0 height=16 src="images/rd_ball.gif" width=17><em>Pilot IT projects in the best stores:</em><br>this raises expectations of systems and leads to better solutions.</p>
<p><IMG alt=bullet border=0 height=16 src="images/rd_ball.gif" width=17><em>Roll out as fast as you can:</em><br>There is no return on investment in piloting. Wal-Mart rolls out projects within weeks of testing.</p>
<p><IMG alt=bullet border=0 height=16 src="images/rd_ball.gif" width=17><em>Do not outsource:</em><br>No outsourcer should be able to do the work more cheaply than your own IT department.</p>
<p><IMG alt=bullet border=0 height=16 src="images/rd_ball.gif" width=17><em>Move staff every few months:</em><br>This encourages people to build up multiple skill sets and builds up expertise within the IT department.</p>
<p><IMG alt=bullet border=0 height=16 src="images/rd_ball.gif" width=17><em>No one is allowed to be a victim:</em><br>IT staff are not allowed to blame delays in the IT project on supplier delays, technical problems and the like. They must take responsibility and find alternative solutions if necessary.</p>
<h3 ><A NAME="KT">Who said that?</A></h3>
These tips are from Kevin Turner. He's Wal-Mart's assistant chief information. His belief - and it seems fair to me - is that generating a return on investment will become the prime driving force behind IT strategies.

He says,
<blockquote>&quot;If you can't calculate the return on investment don't do it,&quot;</blockquote><p><blockquote>&quot;Driving return on investment is nothing to do with doing what customers and the business units want. It's about doing what they need. Stop trying to fix business problems with technology.&quot;</blockquote>
