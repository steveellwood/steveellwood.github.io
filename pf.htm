<h2 title="Summary">Summary</h2>
Public Folders are a widely acceptable form of storing information, in one place for many (or a chosen few) to see.

Issues arise because there is perceived difficulty in providing easy access to this information for people unfamiliar with mail.
One method often discussed is that of using a link from a web page. We'll demonstrate that below. There are some client configuration issues.

This should give you a link to the <A href="showcase.xnk"><img src="images/rd_ball.gif"alt="little red ball">Showcase</A> public folder.

For Netscape users - most of us - the client needs to have it's helper apps specially configured - as below:<p>
Netscape 3 Client Configuration 

If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer then you need do nothing else. <br>
If you are using Netscape, the client will have to be configured to recognise .xnk files<br>
<pre>
                    1.Open Netscape 
                    2.Select Options, then General Preferences 
                    3.Select the Helpers tab 
                    4.Select the Create New Type box 
                    5.Enter mime type: application 
                    6.Enter mime sub type: xnk 
                    7.Click on OK 
                    8.Select Launch the application 
                    9.Browse to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Outlook.exe and click on Open 
                   10.You will see the text C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Outlook.exe in the box.
                      Select the text and edit the right hand of the line so it now reads :
                       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Outlook.exe /x 
                       (with a space and /x added at the end) 
                   11.Click on OK
