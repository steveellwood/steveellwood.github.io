	<h1>Steve's borrowed knife</h1>

	<p>Sorry to disappoint. A Camp Tramp is a *big knife*</p>

<p>Knowing of my interest in Swamp Rat knives, following my order of a Rat Trap, and growing interest in their FB range, a rash but characteristically generous mojo decided to lend me a Camp Tramp for a look-see.</p>

<p>This is a real imaginary pirates knife. A true Crocodile Dundee "Nah, that's not a knife. *THIS* is a knife" knife.</p>

<p>It's big. Black with a crinkle coating on it. It's made out of 1/4" steel F"goodness"sake! The handle is a proprietary Resiprene, comfortably firm but yielding in the handle suitable for long work with the blade. These blades have a "certain reputation" not harmed by some of the daft things that the *makers* state as reproducible. Chopping concrete blocks? Bending to 45 degrees in a vice?</p>

<p>Stay calm stuarty, I didn't do that. I chopped some vegetables, and stuck it into some wood. SWMBO quite likes the knife. What she'll think when the BG (2" longer) arrives...</p>

<p>I'd like to give you some naff impressions of what the knife is like.</p>
<p>I'll set it in context.</p>

<p>Most NKP would understand a Remington Stockman as being a suitable knife.
Here's what one of them looks like, to a NKP.

<p><a id="ukpk" />We know what a UKPK looks like, a tad bigger.

<p><a id="manix" />Stick a Manix into the frame, and we're talking a proper knife</p>

<p><a id="maxx" />Now, if you're a dozy "big knife turbo-nutter" you might have a BIG knife.
<img alt="CUDA Maxx" src="./images/BB/ct4a.jpg" /></p>

<p>That's a Maxx 5.5. That's a BIG knife.</p>

<p>Nah.</p>

<p><a id="ct" />This is a big knife.

<p>Against the Maxx? It dwarfs it.

<p><a id="axe" />The only thing with a bigger width is an axe.</p>
<p>So, here's a GB Small Forest Axe.

<p>The knife is huge in the hand.

<p>The characteristic finger choil after the handle does permit more delicate work. Who am I kidding? This knife cuts slices off Abrams tanks...

<p>Thanks to mojo for the loan, and apologies for the naff photos and tale!</p>
